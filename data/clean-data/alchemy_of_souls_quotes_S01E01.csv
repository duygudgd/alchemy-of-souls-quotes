1,1,219677,221179,Jang Gang,I shall retrieve his soul.
1,1,223932,226392,Geon's mother,No! You were the one who turned my son into a soul shifter.
1,1,235944,240615,Jang Gang,"If word gets out that I used forbidden sorcery, we will both be doomed."
1,1,331914,338338,Jang Gang,"A crack forms when the bodies clash with the souls they carry, which causes them to lose energy."
1,1,342133,344552,Jang Gang,I guess I should stop shifting souls.
1,1,443985,445862,Jang Gang,The alchemy of souls. That is forbidden sorcery.
1,1,740948,754462,Jang Uk,"The energy of the sky rules the wind, clouds, and rain. This energy reached the ground and created a huge form of energy. A country was built around Lake Gyeongcheondaeho, a lake that embodied that energy."
1,1,760259,765264,Jang Uk,Humans who had the power to control this great energy were called mages.
1,1,767224,772396,Jang Uk,"This story is about the mages of Daeho, a place that does not exist in both history books or maps."
1,1,807097,814772,Naksu,"They call me Naksu, for wherever I go, heads fall to the ground. A beautiful name, is it not?"
1,1,1262427,1272813,Heo Yeom,"This mark shows that her soul has left the body. Remember this mark. When someone tries to switch bodies, it leaves a blue bruise like this right on top of their heart."

1,1,1281154,1287286,Park Jin,"This proves that her soul has escaped her body, but we found no signs of her soul having entered another body."
1,1,1312644,1320235,Heo Yeom,"She may have been an assassin who killed people like it was nothing, but she was still human. She must have had a story of her own."
1,1,1330829,1333040,Park Jin,Word will spread about the alchemy of souls.
1,1,1333707,1336710,Heo Yeom,Has it been 20 years since we have seen a soul shifter?
1,1,1357230,1360692,Park Jin,You seem awfully excited to start rumors.
1,1,1449906,1454119,Jang Uk,"Now that I have learned a big lesson, I would like to end it and leave."
1,1,1499456,1504211,Monk Ho-Yeong,No one in this world will teach you spells because of your father.
1,1,1507881,1515263,Jang Uk,I will find my own master. Someone extremely powerful and skilled.
1,1,1726099,1729227,Mu-deok / Naksu,I should not switch bodies too soon. Let us stay as Mu-deok for now.
1,1,1894517,1978685,Ju-Wol,"And they are called the Four Seasons. The daughter of the Jin family who has the vitality of spring: Jin Cho-yeon. The heir of the Park family who has the energy of a hot summer: Park Dang-gu. The genius of the Seo family who is as noble as the sunset in fall: Seo Yul. Then there is Jang Uk, the successor of the Jang family who is as dazzling as the winter snow."
1,1,1986401,1994325,Ju-Wol,"The Jin, Park, Seo, and Jang family. They are the most well-known mage families in Daeho. Their children are known as the Four Seasons."
1,1,2463043,2468382,Park Dang-Gu,You flick energy with a blade just like how you flick water. A single strike is enough to kill someone.
1,1,2495117,2503417,Jang Uk,"Yes, she aimed at my vital point in just one go. But why did she roll off then? "
1,1,3248870,3252874,Park Jin,You cannot even take out your own father's sword. How do you expect to learn spells?
1,1,3267263,3271726,Park Jin,No one in Daeho will be able to go against your father and open your gate of energy. 
1,1,3284322,3286241,Jang Uk,Why would he decide my own fate?
1,1,3291413,3304342,Jang Uk,I will find someone myself. A master who will open my gate of energy and teach me how to practice spells. Then I will take out that sword and break it in two.
1,1,4071150,4076864,Jang Uk,I knew the moment I saw you. You are my master.
1,1,4120616,4129917,Jang Uk,"The soul shifter Naksu, the Shadow Assassin, I have been searching for someone who can break this spell to call my master. I want you to be my master."
