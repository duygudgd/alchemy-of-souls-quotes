1
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,679
Is that the alchemy of souls?

2
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,985
Is my soul being shifted right now?

3
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,349
My soul did not shift.

4
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,271
What happened?

5
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,065
Jang Uk.

6
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,240
Uk!

7
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,698
Uk!

8
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,037
Uk!

9
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,845
So you have shifted souls
with my pupil, Gil-ju.

10
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,719
Mu-deok.

11
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,017
I may have been too weak
to protect him from you.

12
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,357
But I will make sure to end your life.

13
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,447
I did not know

14
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,241
you cared about Jang Uk that much.

15
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,203
Shut it!

16
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,500
Master!

17
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,712
It is me, Jang Uk.

18
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,876
We did not shift souls.

19
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,223
Look into my eyes.

20
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,801
It is me, right?

21
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,055
I am the only one
who can look at you from this close.

22
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,110
Do you recognize me?

23
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,016
He had the blue mark on his body.

24
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,685
His soul must have re-entered his body.

25
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,068
Then why am I fine?

26
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,114
You are wrong.

27
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,412
You have changed as well. Look.

28
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,910
You do not have the bracelet,
yet you are not trembling.

29
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,463
You are right. I can move it freely now.

30
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,921
The Soul Ejector helped surge your energy.

31
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,712
The poison opened your gate of energy,
and the Soul Ejector surged your energy.

32
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,089
Uk, you truly are astoundingly lucky.

33
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,597
I am certain that I saw you there.

34
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,651
What?

35
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,287
Why?

36
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,803
Why are you fine?

37
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,839
You must have failed
due to your weak energy.

38
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,054
You are a soul shifter as well.

39
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,965
Naksu, you will also

40
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,927
be petrified and perish eventually.

41
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,057
Just like me

42
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,899
and your father.

43
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,897
My father?

44
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,569
That is right.

45
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,910
The constellation recorder mage.

46
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,702
Cho Chung!

47
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,037
My father…

48
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,293
was a soul shifter?

49
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,670
The four families were not the ones
who killed your entire family.

50
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,263
It was your father.
He had run wild and murdered them all.

51
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,389
Stay inside and do not come out.

52
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,385
If you see your father, run away.

53
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,098
Do not let him catch you.

54
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,703
Both you and your father were exploited

55
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,776
and will eventually be petrified and die.

56
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,741
Was the man who shifted my father's soul,

57
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,289
the Danju,

58
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,371
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan?

59
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,917
Jin Mu is not our true Danju.

60
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,549
The real Danju is someone else.

61
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,675
-And who is that?
-The true Danju

62
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,345
can prevent you from running wild

63
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,517
since the real Danju
possesses the ice stone.

64
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,850
So who is the real Danju?

65
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,707
Mu-deok, are you all right?

66
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,172
I am fine.

67
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,969
Go after him. Hurry!

68
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,053
I must get out of here

69
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,716
before the poison
from the sorcery spreads.

70
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,329
Search the area.

71
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,660
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

72
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,228
It is empty.

73
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,686
It felt the energy of the sorcery.

74
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,857
Master Heo was right.
This Sapsali was indeed Gwigu.

75
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,779
Did the alchemy of souls
really take place here?

76
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,785
What are those?

77
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,747
They were on the ground.

78
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,129
Maybe this is the Soul Ejector.

79
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,139
This bracelet…

80
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,023
Is this not
Young Master Jang's binding bracelet?

81
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,769
Why is this here?

82
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,983
Does this mean Uk was here?

83
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,984
They fought here.

84
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,237
Do you think something happened to him?

85
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,122
Please return to Songrim
and report what you saw here.

86
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,044
Dang-gu, go inside the fortress
and look for Uk.

87
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,040
-I will search this area.
-All right.

88
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,407
How did the Songrim mages
know to come here?

89
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,302
You are a soul shifter as well.

90
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,598
Naksu, you will also

91
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,725
be petrified and perish eventually.

92
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,809
Just like me

93
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,059
and your father.

94
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,985
Father.

95
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,973
Both you and your father…

96
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,219
were exploited and will eventually

97
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,813
be petrified and die.

98
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,587
Why?

99
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,956
Why is it you again?

100
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,215
Is that the soul shifter?

101
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,305
No, she is Uk's maid.

102
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,640
I accidentally hurt her,
so I must get her treated.

103
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,067
Goodness, what a day.

104
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,823
Gosh. Business was good today.

105
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,080
I must refill my energy,
or I will be petrified.

106
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,790
-Are you done?
-Yes, I am.

107
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,208
Then let us have a drink.

108
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,920
-All right.
-Hurry up!

109
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,166
Let us go.

110
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,142
I cannot return if I cause a commotion.

111
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,140
I need to find somewhere quiet
where I can take their energy.

112
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,647
Please move aside.

113
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,986
Right. Please go ahead.

114
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,864
Master.

115
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,197
You cannot fool us
with those obvious tricks.

116
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,001
You have been following her
ever since you entered the capital.

117
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,842
That man has been following us.

118
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,972
You followed her all the way to this inn.

119
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,429
We just shared
the same destination, that is all.

120
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,636
Do not lie.

121
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,516
You were staring at her the entire time!

122
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,734
I was not.

123
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,813
Sun-i.

124
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,193
Do not embarrass him anymore.

125
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,574
To follow me to my accommodation
was rude and uncomfortable.

126
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,118
If you do not want me
to find another inn this late,

127
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,333
please leave.

128
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,172
Lady.

129
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,339
Why do you think I was following you?

130
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,799
You are neither my debtor

131
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,129
nor someone I know,
so why do you think I followed you?

132
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,176
-That is because she is very--
-Shut up, Sun-i.

133
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,350
I want you to answer me.

134
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,726
Many men have given me trouble
because they followed me due to my looks.

135
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,982
So I thought

136
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,819
you were just one of them.

137
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,229
I see.

138
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:31,991
You are wrong.

139
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,743
Your looks did not impress me,

140
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,198
and I did not follow you either.

141
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,198
If that is the case,

142
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,535
I am sorry.

143
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,543
Then may I go upstairs now?

144
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,474
-Young Lady Heo.
-Yes?

145
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,177
You must eat.

146
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,397
Did that scum--

147
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,444
I mean…

148
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,902
Are you that embarrassed
that you might run into him again?

149
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,442
That is not why.

150
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,914
I just do not feel well.

151
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,239
You should change into dry clothes.

152
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,744
I will get some porridge for you.

153
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,596
Are you all right?

154
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,734
What was that?

155
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,559
Were you after him?

156
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,608
Yes.

157
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,113
I am glad that you are unscathed.

158
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,074
Wait.

159
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,738
Thank you.

160
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,780
If you feel unwell,

161
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,325
visit Sejukwon in Songrim.

162
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,951
Do you know Sejukwon?

163
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,747
I am Sejukwon's…

164
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,586
Heo Yun-ok.

165
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,977
Seeing that you have it
instead of your friend,

166
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,105
I am guessing that friend is gone.

167
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,907
You knew…

168
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,452
who I was all along.

169
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,973
Are you all right?

170
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,768
Hey, are you all right?

171
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,691
Try getting up. Slowly.

172
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,824
It is a monster!

173
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,953
A soul shifter.

174
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,109
It is a soul shifter!

175
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,447
-A soul shifter!
-A soul shifter!

176
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,439
The real Danju is someone else.

177
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,124
The true Danju
can prevent you from running wild.

178
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,948
Go on. Go to your Danju.

179
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,825
Gil-ju went missing?

180
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,673
We have not heard from him
ever since he went after Jang Uk's maid.

181
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,800
Jang Uk's maid?

182
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,171
Why would he go after her?

183
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,926
To be honest,
he had been after Jang Uk all along.

184
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,679
The Spirit Plaque Naksu had left
was actually Jang Uk's.

185
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,562
He must have been after Jang Uk,
thinking he was involved.

186
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,903
Then you should have told me sooner!

187
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,771
He told me to stay silent.

188
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,146
He must have wanted
to find firm evidence first.

189
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,895
Order all of our mages to look for Gil-ju.

190
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,829
Uk's binding bracelet was found

191
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,371
in the spot where
the alchemy of souls had taken place?

192
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,955
Dang-gu is looking for Young Master Jang.

193
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,080
Young Master Seo is searching
the area around the temple.

194
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,787
-They were at the temple?
-Yes, my lord.

195
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,918
I doubt Uk was capable
of carrying out the alchemy of souls.

196
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,337
Master Lee,

197
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,925
what if someone else's soul
has shifted into Uk's body?

198
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,761
Do not worry. I am sure he is fine.

199
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,563
She will protect him.

200
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,806
By the way,

201
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,607
where is our leader among all this chaos?

202
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,236
Before Uk was born…

203
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,028
About 20 years ago…

204
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,616
Did Jang Gang

205
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,333
perform the alchemy of souls?

206
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,843
The Gwanju of Cheonbugwan
performing sorcery?

207
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,000
That is absurd.

208
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,298
Jin Mu told me about it.

209
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,974
I could not dare to hear from him,

210
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,966
so I came to you instead.

211
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,813
Madam Do-hwa…

212
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,771
was indeed once concerned

213
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,692
that the Gwanju was interested
in learning a strange spell.

214
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,816
However, it did not last long.

215
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,655
He did not come home for a year.

216
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,833
He practiced spells with Jin Mu
in the Cheonbugwan Secret Room.

217
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,871
However,

218
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,754
he stopped doing so
after his wife became pregnant.

219
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,550
Do-hwa gave birth to the late king's son.

220
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,296
The late king

221
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,803
passed due to a severe illness
and could not even move.

222
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,257
So how is that possible?

223
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,694
The alchemy of souls
would have made that possible.

224
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,016
As a mage,

225
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,527
he was just briefly curious about it.

226
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,529
No.

227
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,162
He committed something

228
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,906
irreparable…

229
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,700
to Do-hwa and Uk.

230
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,376
A mage of Jeongjingak
is urgently looking for our young master.

231
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,896
I did not know you were here as well.

232
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,269
What is it?

233
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,650
I think Uk

234
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,284
fell victim to the alchemy of souls.

235
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,452
What?

236
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,215
That is Cheonbugwan.

237
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,734
Could the real Danju
be inside those walls?

238
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,495
This is the way to the royal palace.

239
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:35,165
Could the real Danju be in there?

240
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,143
I am from Cheonbugwan.

241
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,600
It must be urgent.

242
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,026
Let me see your face.

243
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,031
This is urgent. Move aside.

244
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,413
Let me see your face.

245
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,968
A soul shifter.

246
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,062
Go after him!

247
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,788
So the real Danju is inside the palace.

248
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,761
The ice stone, was it?

249
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,473
You mentioned it.

250
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,255
I will find that and prevent her
from meeting the same fate as you.

251
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,922
Hold on. Is he really…

252
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,260
Look at him!

253
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,880
Is he really dead?

254
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,756
-Touch him.
-Should I?

255
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,933
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

256
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,861
He tried to enter the palace
while running wild.

257
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,950
Did you kill him?

258
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,452
How could we?

259
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,365
An unknown mage suddenly appeared
and used a spell on him.

260
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,382
Which family was he from?
Did you see his face?

261
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,998
No, my lord.
It was covered with a blue cloth.

262
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,745
However, I did see which spell he used.

263
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,389
It was Tansu.

264
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,728
-Tansu?
-Yes, I am sure of it.

265
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,402
He flicked energy with his sword.

266
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,187
Tansu was the spell Naksu used.

267
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,276
Was there another mage
who had mastered it?

268
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,790
I heard you caught
a soul shifter who had run wild.

269
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,748
We came here to see who it was.

270
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,966
Sure. Feel free to take a look at him.

271
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,985
Is he not Gil-ju,

272
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,657
one of your men?

273
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,750
That is correct.

274
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,839
Bring his body inside
and make everyone leave.

275
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,800
Yes, my lord.

276
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,597
Jin Mu was with me
when the alchemy of souls took place.

277
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,021
He is panicking as well.

278
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,477
He was not aware
of this alchemy of souls either.

279
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,569
I will take care of this
since it occurred inside Cheonbugwan.

280
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,360
It has nothing to do with Songrim.

281
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,150
Sure.

282
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,865
However, please ask us for help

283
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,790
if you ever need any.

284
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,831
Another soul shifter had run wild?

285
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,536
Fortunately, he was caught
and died of petrification.

286
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,628
And who was this soul shifter?

287
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,923
It was

288
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,216
Gil-ju, a mage of Cheonbugwan.

289
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,183
Gil-ju had become a soul shifter?

290
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,271
Then was he caught in Cheonbugwan?

291
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,351
He was caught in front of the palace.

292
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,476
He tried to enter the premises
after running wild.

293
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,150
He was on his way here?

294
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,404
Then a mage suddenly appeared

295
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,606
and subdued him by using Tansu.

296
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,990
And who was this mage?

297
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,657
Naksu was the one who killed Gil-ju.

298
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,997
-What?
-Naksu?

299
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,502
She is back!

300
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,463
-Naksu?
-The assassin?

301
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:34,052
Last night, the mage who appeared
in front of the palace used Tansu.

302
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,932
That was the spell Naksu used.

303
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,718
-Goodness.
-Really?

304
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,182
-It was hers?
-My gosh.

305
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,562
Hold on!

306
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,968
Naksu is dead.

307
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,926
-Right.
-Right.

308
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,935
Everyone here witnessed
her body turn to ash.

309
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,348
I saw it with my own two eyes.

310
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,607
-That is right.
-True.

311
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,109
Unlike her body, her soul is still alive.

312
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,571
The Shadow Assassin
has returned as a soul shifter!

313
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,323
-What?
-Is that true?

314
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,315
-That cannot be.
-Really?

315
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,277
But Naksu is female.

316
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,407
It was a man who killed Gil-ju.

317
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,664
He was a tall, young man
with a blue cloth covering his face.

318
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,331
Naksu shifted souls, right?

319
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,087
She must have shifted souls
with that tall man.

320
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,800
Then she must have become stronger.

321
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,970
She was powerful to begin with.

322
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,511
But she has become invincible
thanks to shifting into a strong body.

323
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,144
Murdering Gil-ju is her revenge

324
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,685
on Cheonbugwan for burning her body

325
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,863
and killing her men.

326
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,358
Why us?

327
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,320
Songrim was the one who killed Naksu.

328
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:40,068
"The invincible Naksu
dressed in blue cloth has returned,

329
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,736
and Songrim is her next target."

330
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,995
This is the rumor
that I have been hearing.

331
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,958
The soul shifter was caught
only a few hours ago.

332
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,830
How is it we already have
such absurd rumors?

333
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:55,207
Such rumors tend to spread
like wildfire and be exaggerated.

334
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,956
And the rumor is reasonable.

335
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,008
The mage who killed Gil-ju used Tansu,

336
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,472
and that is exactly the spell Naksu used.

337
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,473
Who said she was the only one
who could use it?

338
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,767
I could master it
right now if I wanted to.

339
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,271
If this rumor spreads within Songrim,

340
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,436
I will hold you responsible.
So make sure that never happens.

341
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,275
Yes, my lord.

342
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,656
I am truly relieved
that it was not Young Master Jang

343
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,162
who had shifted souls and died.

344
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,288
But then why did we find
his belongings there?

345
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,168
We will know once we find him.

346
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,756
You do not look too well.

347
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,389
You should

348
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,484
go home and wait for him there.

349
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,534
Are you feeling very unwell?

350
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,199
I was so surprised
that the honey biscuit I had last night

351
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,288
is giving me indigestion.

352
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,303
I was so shocked
when I heard about his soul shifting

353
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,708
that even my soul exited
and entered my body again.

354
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,267
Is it really back?

355
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,515
Is that you, Maidservant Kim?

356
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,864
No, my lord. I am Maidservant Park.

357
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,696
If I could, I would like to slap
Young Master Park's back for shocking me.

358
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,200
Slap mine instead.

359
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,156
I can allow that for Maidservant Park.

360
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,826
Go on.

361
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,673
I have pretty strong hands.

362
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,709
It will hurt.

363
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,795
I will not be a baby about it,

364
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,169
so go on.

365
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,876
Goodness.

366
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,720
This means you have already hit me once.

367
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,345
Why?

368
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,177
Are you going to do something
to make me upset?

369
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,767
Then take it back.

370
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,193
Hit me back.

371
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,152
Go on.

372
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,567
Hurry up.

373
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,449
I do not want…

374
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,871
to hurt you.

375
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,206
As Songrim's leader,

376
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,418
there will come a time
when I will have to be cold and heartless.

377
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,417
But I truly

378
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,217
do not want to hurt you.

379
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,218
Is your heart troubled

380
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:56,225
because of what you asked me yesterday
regarding Master Jang Gang?

381
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,771
There has been chaos lately.

382
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,864
But I have failed to be objective

383
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,817
as the leader.

384
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,897
Your slap helped me come to my senses.

385
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,948
I must act wisely from now on.

386
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,041
Feel free to hit me every now and then

387
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,964
as Maidservant Park.

388
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,047
If it is you,

389
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,626
I can allow that.

390
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,154
Why are you here?

391
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,782
Master Heo ordered me
to trace the root of the sorcery.

392
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,150
And this is what I found here.

393
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,275
I must have left it behind.

394
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,240
Do you not need it anymore?

395
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,076
No, I am fine now.

396
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,248
I almost lost that Jin family treasure.

397
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,593
Thank you for finding it.

398
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,713
You also left something else.

399
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,836
Are you not looking for Mu-deok?

400
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,925
Where is she?

401
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,309
I found her hiding in the forest.

402
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,685
She was injured and bleeding profusely.

403
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,912
Mu-deok.

404
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,790
Young Master.

405
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,790
How could you leave me behind?

406
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,884
What?

407
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:48,087
You ran away and left me behind.

408
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,423
Go along with it.

409
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:57,216
Right. I did indeed run away.

410
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,766
That is right.

411
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,139
We had spotted the soul shifter
when we took shelter from the rain.

412
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,518
But thanks to you,

413
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,904
I almost got ripped into shreds
by that soul shifter.

414
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,441
I am sorry.

415
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,739
I was too terrified
that I did not think twice and ran away.

416
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,696
Yul mistook Mu-deok for the soul shifter
and almost killed her.

417
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,422
Had he not treated her right away,
she would have died.

418
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,424
Yul.

419
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:35,427
Thanks for rescuing and treating Mu-deok.

420
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,098
Did you really run away
and leave her behind?

421
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,729
Had I fought, I would have died.

422
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,820
We need to be selfish at times.

423
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,411
Why are you staring at me?
Do you not agree?

424
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,043
In any case, I am glad

425
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,829
that both of us are fine.

426
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,263
Right.

427
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,385
I heard you are hiding in Danhyanggok.

428
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,854
Did you hear that our leader made Songrim

429
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,064
take responsibility
for the dishonor you made?

430
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,645
Jeez, I am sick of this.

431
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,817
Why would he do that
when I am not from Songrim?

432
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,029
The duel with the Crown Prince
is in two weeks.

433
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:37,242
Do not enter the fortress
or cause any more trouble until then.

434
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,533
Just lie low.

435
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,788
Thank you for treating me.

436
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,964
Uk seems fine
without the binding bracelet.

437
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,254
I guess he can control his energy now.

438
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,428
He risked his life
and got what he wanted once again.

439
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,009
And you were by his side again.

440
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,595
If you were so bothered by that
you should have just let me die.

441
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,346
Next time,

442
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,484
I might have to do just that.

443
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,573
Mu-deok.

444
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,907
Coming, Young Master.

445
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,701
Bye.

446
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,634
Uk was unscathed.

447
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,455
That is a relief.

448
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,301
Did he see

449
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,893
who was with Gil-ju
when the latter shifted souls?

450
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,888
That person was probably
the one in the blue cloth.

451
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,391
He was too busy running away to look back.

452
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,184
Did you ask his maid?

453
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,352
She must have witnessed the spell.

454
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,607
Mu-deok…

455
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,784
She probably will not know
even if she saw it.

456
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,752
She is an ordinary maid
who does not know such spells.

457
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,575
What happened to your hand?

458
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,165
Did you injure it?

459
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,763
The Soul Ejector I had touched yesterday
had some leftover poison from the sorcery.

460
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,682
But I am fine.

461
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,715
I shall take my leave.

462
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,683
Why did you want to see me this time?

463
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:10,765
I heard you had taken
my wedding gifts that had arrived.

464
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,733
Why did you do that?

465
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,941
Were you worried I would destroy them?

466
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:20,033
I will keep them stored and give them back
during your next wedding.

467
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,989
Just throw them away.

468
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,410
Marriage is out of the picture for me.

469
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,527
Do not be so embarrassed.

470
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,118
Your wedding was prepared in secret,
so not many know of it.

471
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,126
Really?

472
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,507
Cho-yeon!

473
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,893
I heard you are getting married.

474
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,807
I heard you bought gifts
and hired a craftsman for your rings.

475
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,098
I guess word got out.

476
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,104
Congratulations.

477
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,435
Congratulations, Young Master Park.

478
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,774
-Me?
-I know you two are getting married.

479
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,687
He received the wedding gifts

480
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,606
and went with you to get your rings.

481
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,824
Right?

482
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,744
There was an absurd rumor
about you marrying Uk again.

483
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,284
No, right?

484
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,037
You are marrying Young Master Park, right?

485
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,753
That is true.

486
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,749
But please keep it quiet

487
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,251
since it is a secret.

488
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:17,995
All right.

489
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,797
See you later.

490
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,416
I told you it was Dang-gu.

491
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,587
You are right.
She would be crazy to wed Uk again.

492
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,257
Tell me about it.

493
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,021
Young Master Park.

494
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,889
Why did you say yes?

495
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,766
This is better
than getting rejected by Uk twice.

496
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,186
Let us say
you broke it off with me this time.

497
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,074
After all, it will just be a rumor.

498
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,994
Will you be all right with that?

499
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,487
You will be embarrassed.

500
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,951
That is fine by me.

501
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:19,897
Filthy Mu-deok?

502
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,941
Are you back here again?
Were you unharmed?

503
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:25,943
Sorry?

504
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,414
Forget it. Move aside.

505
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,707
Are you looking for Mu-deok again?

506
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,539
Never mind.
Her dress just looked familiar.

507
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,337
Mu-deok sold it to us.

508
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,088
-She sold it?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

509
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,094
She said a thoughtless, young man
had given it to her.

510
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,597
She sold it saying

511
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,638
that he was well-off
and would not want it back.

512
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,885
Did she really say that?

513
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:01,766
That is right. Filthy Mu-deok and silk
do not go hand in hand.

514
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,981
Watch what you say.

515
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,613
Sorry?

516
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:09,072
That is a nickname that I have given her.
Only I can call her that.

517
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,284
So do not call her that.

518
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,279
I am sorry, Your Royal Highness.

519
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,082
Also…

520
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,462
she did not look too bad
in that silk dress.

521
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,535
She looked much better
than you in that blue cloth.

522
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,796
You must not like this.

523
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,630
What is that?

524
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,344
Everyone here was wearing one.

525
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,465
This is Naksu's cloth.

526
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,602
Whose cloth?

527
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,059
Naksu, the soul shifter, killed a mage
of Cheonbugwan in front of the palace.

528
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,811
Naksu had a blue cloth like this one.

529
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:43,523
This blue cloth has become
a trend within the capital's walls.

530
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,319
-Come and buy Naksu's blue cloth.
-I got one.

531
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,156
It will prevent your soul
from getting shifted.

532
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,661
-This one.
-Take it.

533
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,162
I would like one too.

534
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,455
-This is Naksu's cloth.
-Try this on.

535
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,207
Naksu, the soul shifter in blue?

536
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,588
Everyone thinks Naksu
has returned from the dead.

537
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,140
But thanks to Naksu in Blue,

538
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,891
they have lost interest
in Uk's duel with the Crown Prince.

539
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,018
I wonder where Uk and Mu-deok are.

540
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,515
They were not in Danhyanggok either.

541
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,857
I am sure they are safe.

542
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,186
They will return after two weeks.

543
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,284
By the way, Yul…

544
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,577
I got one too. Do you want to try it on?

545
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,251
All right.

546
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,378
Who in the world could it be?

547
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,636
This Naksu in blue cloth who uses Tansu?

548
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,773
Did you say
this was the soul shifters' grave?

549
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,935
Then he must be buried here.

550
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:11,937
Your father.

551
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,494
As a little girl,

552
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,791
I thought he was unjustly murdered
by the mages of the four families.

553
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,115
Jin Mu took me under his wing,
and I called him Danju.

554
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,246
However…

555
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,375
my father was a soul shifter
who used sorcery.

556
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,377
And I was used and abandoned.

557
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,508
Like Gil-ju said,

558
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,388
I will eventually run wild as well.

559
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,648
Once I become petrified,

560
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,737
will you leave me here?

561
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:09,327
I found out where the real Danju was.

562
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:14,052
Inside the palace.
The true Danju is in there.

563
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,390
Please tell me about the ice stone.

564
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,346
Are you certain

565
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,193
that the ice stone was indeed destroyed

566
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,283
by Master Seo Gyeong
and the leader of Jinyowon 200 years ago?

567
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,649
Are you sure…

568
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,699
it is not somewhere in Songrim?

569
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,807
Hello, Danju.

570
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,783
Gil-ju wanted the ice stone
and headed to the palace to see me.

571
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,121
I was not aware

572
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,578
that Gil-ju knew who the real Danju was.

573
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,210
The day the Choi family regains power,

574
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:36,764
Songrim, the cause
of our family's downfall, gets destroyed,

575
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,967
and I control Daeho, is approaching.

576
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,260
And I have been waiting
for that day with bated breath.

577
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,102
We must find and kill the one
who killed Gil-ju in front of the palace.

578
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,074
That individual may have waited
for Gil-ju to go there,

579
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,898
knowing the latter
was after the ice stone.

580
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,574
If that individual knows
that the ice stone is in there,

581
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,451
you must find

582
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,873
and kill them.

583
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,914
I do not know who it is,

584
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,917
but the Danju inside the palace
has the ice stone.

585
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,710
And with that, Gil-ju said
a soul shifter may not run wild.

586
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,047
Are you saying we should enter
the royal palace and look for the Danju?

587
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,143
It is impossible in my current state.

588
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,388
I am a low-class mage
that was rejected by Jeongjingak.

589
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,604
However, I will keep climbing up.

590
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,226
And I will eventually enter
the palace walls.

591
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,864
Master.

592
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,358
I will find

593
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,782
that ice stone for you.

594
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,333
Uk.

595
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,542
Your master is neither strong enough
to pull you up

596
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,292
nor support you from the bottom.

597
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,130
You were never like that to begin with.

598
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,262
You always pushed me to my death.

599
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,680
But whenever you did that,
I found myself on a whole new level.

600
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,306
Keep doing that

601
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,515
and stay by my side.

602
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,700
Fine.

603
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,789
I will do that and push you

604
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,210
to your death if you stop.

605
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,823
I will find Uk and make sure
he does not come to fight the duel.

606
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,954
Do not bother.

607
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,830
If he wants to come,

608
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,661
let him.

609
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,414
It is a formal match among mages.

610
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,374
We cannot intervene
even if one of them dies.

611
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,252
If death occurs,

612
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,724
then that is that.

613
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,676
Will you not stop it?

614
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,312
The Unanimous Assembly asked Uk to fight

615
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,484
on Songrim's behalf.

616
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,317
Whether he becomes a coward and runs away

617
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,105
or honorably dies during the duel,

618
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:51,783
I will only watch
as the leader of Songrim.

619
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:28,207
His Majesty and the Queen are here.

620
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,077
One month ago, Go Won,
Daeho's royal Go family member,

621
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:07,705
challenged Jang Uk, the eldest son
of the Jang family, to a duel.

622
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:11,344
And Songrim received
the challenge on Uk's behalf.

623
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,181
Whoever signs the paper

624
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,469
cannot hold his opponent responsible

625
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,468
for their death even if that occurs.

626
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,983
The match will commence at noon.

627
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,726
If he does not show up by then,

628
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,534
we will accept his defeat.

629
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:39,237
You must mention the punishment
he will get if he does not show up.

630
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:47,127
If Jang Uk does not show up today,

631
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:52,007
his right to become
Cheonbugwan's next Gwanju…

632
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,343
will be lost.

633
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,356
Come here.

634
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,945
What are in those crocks?

635
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,414
They are full of water.

636
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,536
Crocks full of water?

637
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,198
My lord, it is noon.

638
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,242
Close the Training Center's door.

639
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,622
I must announce

640
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,371
his defeat.

641
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,354
Close the door.

642
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,659
Jang Uk is here!

643
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:55,922
Young Master…

644
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:27,617
Young Master.

645
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,203
It will be all right.

646
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,091
JANG UK

647
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,358
Now that you have signed the paper,

648
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,942
no one can intervene

649
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,704
even if you die while fighting.

650
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,066
I am aware of that.

651
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,996
Mother.

652
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:13,708
Please use our plaque to stop this duel.

653
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,247
He will surely die
in the Crown Prince's hands.

654
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,335
He showed up because he was ready to die.

655
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,131
Your wedding has fallen through.

656
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,965
His fate has nothing to do with us now.

657
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,861
You may commence the duel.

658
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:11,263
First, do not do anything and just defend.

659
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,517
If you make the first move
with your current skills,

660
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,229
you will die.

661
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,055
You must only attack him

662
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,822
when he loses his focus.

663
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,815
I trust that he has placed them.

664
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,609
Did you say you could enter Songrim
whenever you pleased?

665
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:07,822
Yes. Why?

666
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,413
I have a favor.

667
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,830
Could you put some water
in the Training Center

668
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,989
so that he can use Tansu during the duel?

669
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,175
I feel uneasy about those crocks.

670
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:34,848
Break them.

671
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,697
Young Master.

672
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,498
Tansu.

673
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,399
Your Royal Highness.

674
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,571
The match

675
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,278
has ended.

676
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,662
This is cheating. It does not count!

677
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:29,051
That was Tansu.

678
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,922
Only those
who have reached Chisu can do it.

679
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:37,549
How could he have mastered that
when his gate of energy just opened?

680
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:38,966
I am certain

681
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,305
that a master has helped him in secret.

682
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,521
How could anyone have possibly helped him

683
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,443
when all of us were watching?

684
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,981
Do not be stubborn!

685
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,567
Jang Uk, tell us yourself.

686
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,200
Is it true that you have learned Tansu

687
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:55,988
by reaching Chisu in such a short time?

688
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:58,871
That is not true.

689
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,794
I do not know how to gather my energy.

690
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,119
I can only use Tansu if there is water.

691
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,415
I only learned how to flick the water.

692
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,790
Then who taught you that?

693
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,797
Someone must have taught you that skill.

694
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,007
No one did.

695
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:20,969
Look at him.

696
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,140
He is being ridiculous,

697
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,774
claiming that
he learned it single-handedly.

698
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:31,444
I spotted some water crocks
in this building.

699
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,190
Who placed them here?

700
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,702
Was it your master?

701
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,034
I trained by myself.

702
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,488
I will not buy that!

703
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,447
Jang Uk, explain yourself.

704
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:52,036
Who helped you train all this time?

705
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,259
It was me.

706
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,491
I was with him.

707
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,449
Everything he just said is true.

708
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,289
And who are you?

709
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,124
How dare you intervene?

710
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:30,286
Silence!

711
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,711
He is Hemp Master Lee,

712
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,504
a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.

713
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,418
Greet him this instant!

714
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,641
Goodness. Hello, master.

715
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,892
I saw everything
during my time in Danhyanggok with him.

716
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,686
He practiced flicking waterdrops
all day long.

717
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,439
And by his side

718
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,323
was no one other than his maid.

719
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,414
Master Lee has vouched for him.

720
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:11,923
Do you have any other objections?

721
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:48,487
Let us go, Your Majesty.

722
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,354
Bring Jang Uk into Cheonbugwan.

723
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:24,905
The son of Gwanju Jang Gang
is incredible indeed.

724
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:30,039
Since you do not have a master yet,
Cheonbugwan will happily accept you.

725
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,708
Do not be ridiculous.

726
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:35,118
If anything, I should be his master.

727
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:38,337
I opened his gate of energy
and gave him a torrent of my energy.

728
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,839
Uk, come to Sejukwon.

729
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:43,221
I will teach you what I know.

730
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,549
How about joining Jinyowon?

731
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,143
As Cho-yeon's former betrothed,

732
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:52,471
we will consider you family
and teach you our spells.

733
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,147
Jang Uk.

734
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,283
If you wish to join Songrim Jeongjingak,

735
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,275
we will accept you.

736
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:24,594
Mu-deok.

737
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:28,433
They all want me. Where should I go?

738
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,688
You should join Songrim for now,

739
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:44,687
Young Master.

740
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,793
I, Jang Uk,
the eldest son of the Jang family,

741
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,671
will join Songrim Jeongjingak.

742
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,812
Young Master Jang has become
a mage of Jeongjingak.

743
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:03,113
We have a welcome ceremony
for our newest mage, Jang Uk.

744
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,942
I hate your master so much,
it is gut-wrenching.

745
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:06,944
Of course.

746
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,945
If that love is fickle,
then I do not need it.

747
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:12,990
Please let me in.

748
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:13,913
Mu-deok.

749
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,331
I must be with my young master.

750
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,540
For now, go home and wait.

751
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,959
Young Master Jang snuck out
and has come home.

752
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,576
Young Master! Wait there.

753
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,836
-I will go to you.
-I found the exam papers.

754
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:26,752
No matter what happens,

755
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:29,257
I will go into Songrim,
where Young Master Jang is.

756
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:30,549
Mu-deok.

757
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,642
I can do anything
if it means being able to see you.

758
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:41,555
