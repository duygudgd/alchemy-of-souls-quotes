1
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,382
Daeho once suffered
from a long and unusual drought.

2
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,720
It was so bad that it even caused
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

3
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,564
to completely dry up.

4
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,567
The mages of Daeho performed a grand rite

5
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,360
to fill the lake back up with energy.

6
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,621
Then enormous hailstones
started falling from the sky.

7
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,668
But among the many hailstones,

8
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,638
there was one that did not melt.

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:41,561
This unmelting hailstone
first turned into fire,

10
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,517
then stone,

11
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,810
and then water.

12
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,243
Then it turned back
into its original form, ice.

13
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,780
In that process, it produced black powder.

14
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,488
This powder was called the Soul Ejector,
which was used in the alchemy of souls.

15
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,041
The power of the Soul Ejector
was truly astonishing.

16
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,799
One could bring the dead back to life
by summoning back their souls.

17
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,302
One could shift souls
from one body to another.

18
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,258
One could even expel
the soul of the living

19
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,847
and steal their energy.

20
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:33,031
Eventually, that boundless power
ended up causing chaos.

21
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,115
In order to possess the unmelting ice
that produced the Soul Ejector,

22
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,795
the battle of mages turned into bloodshed,
and Daeho became a living hell.

23
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,600
The man who ended the long-lasting battle

24
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,310
was Master Seo Gyeong,
the founder of Songrim.

25
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,873
I was his pupil.

26
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,620
That ice stone sounds amazing.

27
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,663
Where is it? I would like to see it.

28
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,288
It is an extremely frightening stone.

29
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,085
Sorcery using the stone's power

30
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,799
created wicked things
that could hurt people.

31
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,552
Boy, where did you get that wooden doll?

32
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,505
I found it up in the mountain.

33
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,387
Would you like to trade it for this?

34
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,936
Yes.

35
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,157
This is a relic cursed with sorcery.

36
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,578
-What was that?
-What was that?

37
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,706
That was a dangerous item
created with sorcery.

38
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,054
I know what they are.
They are called relics.

39
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,466
Jinyowon has lots of them.

40
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,385
That is right.

41
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,298
Inside Jinyowon, there are relics
that are much more dangerous.

42
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,979
There, you will find many peculiar items

43
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,348
that were made
with the power of the ice stone.

44
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:40,702
They sit there waiting for an opportunity
to come out into the world again.

45
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,802
Should I take you in?

46
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,759
No, thank you.

47
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,675
I may be a filthy girl
whom everyone avoids,

48
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,142
but I refuse to serve just anyone.

49
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,391
Damn it. How dare she.

50
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,888
She should have been grateful.

51
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,596
This batch of cinnamon and ginger wine
has quite a strong scent of cinnamon.

52
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,939
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

53
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,605
It smells of cinnamon.

54
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,534
That impudent girl.

55
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,116
Is there something bothering you?

56
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,911
The filth from Filthy Mu-deok
must have gotten on me.

57
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,366
The stench will not go away.

58
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,916
It smells wonderful.

59
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,841
Forget it. Get out.

60
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,842
Leave already.

61
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,434
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

62
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,850
I showed her mercy
and saved her from trouble.

63
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,016
I even gave her my sachet
and a silk dress.

64
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,069
How ungrateful of her.

65
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,747
-I am grateful.
-I told you to leave…

66
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,759
Filthy Mu-deok?

67
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,299
How did you get in here?

68
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,297
I have that sachet you gave me.

69
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,270
You must be here
because you need something from me again.

70
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,940
You have been thinking about me,
Your Royal Highness,

71
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,099
so I came to see you.

72
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,307
Are you saying you can read my mind?

73
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,858
Good.

74
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,487
Have a glass of cinnamon and ginger wine
that is a lot stronger than the last one.

75
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,536
It smells wonderful.

76
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,419
It does?

77
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,467
I must say, I really like this place.

78
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,686
I hope you continue to think of me
just like you did today.

79
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,149
I will come to visit whenever you do.

80
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,239
The palace is a great place.

81
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,707
You get to dress in silk,

82
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,170
and it is filled with different kinds
of aromatic wine.

83
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,465
But do you know
why I keep thinking of you?

84
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,140
Because you are Filthy Mu-deok.

85
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,273
But right now, you do not reek of filth.

86
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,689
Your Royal Highness.

87
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,651
Who are you?

88
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,874
You caught me.

89
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,219
Something wicked just came in here.

90
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,759
-Search around.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

91
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,677
Why did it show up looking like Mu-deok?

92
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,069
Search every corner again.

93
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,440
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

94
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,241
The Crown Prince is here.

95
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,283
The Crown Prince?

96
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,960
I am in search of someone.

97
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,803
I was told that she would be here.

98
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,471
Is there something going on?
There seems to be a disturbance.

99
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,300
A maid caused trouble and disappeared,
so we were looking for her.

100
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,387
A maid?

101
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,221
She does not work for us.

102
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,476
Her name is Mu-deok.
She serves the Jang family.

103
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,189
She is whom I am looking for.

104
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,726
Did something happen?

105
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,481
That maid…

106
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,902
accidentally broke the yin-and-yang jade
that was going to be used

107
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,819
to make my wedding rings.

108
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,750
I told you to be careful.

109
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,159
What will you do now?

110
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,082
I apologize, my lady.

111
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,958
Please forgive me.

112
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,301
I will ask her owner to come here.

113
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,458
Take her away
and lock her up in the annex.

114
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,593
I am sorry!

115
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,467
Forgive me, my lady!

116
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,763
She must have been scared
about getting punished.

117
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,057
While she was locked up,
she stole the jade and ran away.

118
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,357
Seeing as we still have not found her,

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,280
it looks as if she has
already fled this place.

120
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,743
She got scared and ran away?

121
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,124
A bold girl like her?

122
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,754
Mages from Jeongjingak are here to visit.

123
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,170
Your Royal Highness, what brings you here?

124
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,836
What about you, Yul?

125
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,425
To look for someone.

126
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,974
Did you also come here
looking for Mu-deok?

127
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,510
Yes.

128
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,976
I am here for Mu-deok.

129
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,193
She broke the yin-and-yang jade,

130
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,567
then ran away with it
to avoid getting punished.

131
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,698
But why did you not
get the wedding rings made?

132
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,576
I went to Chwiseonru to lend you my hand,
but I heard you already had left.

133
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,455
I just decided to postpone it.

134
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,421
Yul, why are you looking for Mu-deok?

135
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,877
I also saw the exact same illusion as you,
Your Royal Highness.

136
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,315
How did you enter Songrim?

137
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,490
I came because you kept longing for me.

138
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,924
What do you mean?

139
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,590
You were longing for
the one you met at Danhyanggok.

140
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,089
Stop fooling around.

141
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,460
I was longing for you?

142
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,012
-I have never done that.
-You are lying.

143
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,931
You kept the whistle.

144
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,181
The broken leg did not bother you.

145
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,847
And you were not scared to get scolded.

146
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,903
Because you liked her a lot.

147
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,777
Continue to think about her like that.

148
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,117
Then I will come to see you.

149
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,088
You…

150
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,965
are not human.

151
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,812
Are you going to get rid of me?

152
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,270
Then you will never get to see me again.

153
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,392
It was not her. It was an illusion.

154
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,645
Does that mean
what I saw was also an illusion?

155
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,518
It was odd, so I went to Chwiseonru
looking for Mu-deok.

156
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,646
They told me she was dragged here.

157
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,106
She was not dragged here.
She was here to run an errand.

158
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,534
And she disappeared
with something precious.

159
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,116
We are in search of a thief,
not an illusion.

160
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,921
There is her owner.

161
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,354
Is Master Lee not here today again?

162
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,152
He is a man who wanders like the wind.

163
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,355
He left me the dog and left.

164
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,068
Was Gwigu also made from the ice stone?

165
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,952
Master Seo Gyeong made this
with the energy from the ice stone

166
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,161
in hopes of finding traces of sorcery.

167
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,905
Uk broke Gwigu's pottery,

168
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,996
so Master Lee
summoned the spirit from Jinyowon

169
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,328
and put it inside this dog.

170
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,708
Do you really not know
where Master Seo Gyeong

171
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,131
sealed the ice stone?

172
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,969
I do not know.

173
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,849
Do you think the alchemy of souls
started to occur again

174
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,100
because someone managed
to unseal the ice stone?

175
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,982
The only way for someone to shift souls
without mastering Hwansu

176
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,230
is by using the ice stone.

177
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,573
I am certain that someone
unsealed the ice stone

178
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,775
and brought it out into the world again.

179
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,070
Well, that is not good.

180
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:12,287
We cannot let the disaster
from 200 years ago repeat itself.

181
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,917
We must find the ice stone.

182
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,092
I was given orders to give this to you.

183
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,146
I thought you were
going to lie low for a while.

184
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,612
Are you planning on
shifting another person's soul?

185
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,371
Tell them that I safely received this.

186
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,491
I will.

187
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,919
Hurry up and find a eunuch
who can replace him.

188
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,837
Your soul will be shifted into that body,
so choose wisely.

189
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,086
Yes, sir.

190
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,177
I did not serve the Danju

191
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,273
just to shift my soul
into a eunuch's body.

192
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,351
I will use Naksu

193
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,767
to get the body I want.

194
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,196
My maid has committed a disgraceful act.

195
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,701
I am fully responsible as her master.

196
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,157
I apologize.

197
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,090
You must be upset about having lost
the jade to be used for the wedding rings.

198
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,626
I pleaded to my mother
for that yin-and-yang jade.

199
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,588
Yin-and-yang jade wedding rings

200
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,847
allow couples to have
a long and happy marriage.

201
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,175
But it is broken now.

202
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,425
I did not know that
it held such a deep meaning.

203
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,886
I must say, I am upset too.

204
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,476
We will find you a more valuable jade
for the wedding rings.

205
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,856
I appreciate your sincere apology.

206
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,659
-You may all leave now.
-Thank you.

207
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,662
I cannot do that.

208
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,203
I need to find Mu-deok.

209
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,422
I want to find that wicked maid

210
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,128
and have her return the yin-and-yang jade.

211
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,723
She is weak and she has short legs,
so she will not have traveled far.

212
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,350
I would like your permission to stay
and look for her myself.

213
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,306
You have my permission.

214
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,268
Thank you.

215
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,278
Now that I have your permission,
I would like you to open the door.

216
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,149
Open the door to Jinyowon,

217
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,993
where relics and artifacts reside.

218
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,096
Jinyowon's entrance can only be opened
by a member of the Jin family.

219
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,140
Right now, Cho-yeon and I are
the only ones who can open this door.

220
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,055
There is no way she is in there.

221
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,645
I saw Mu-deok's illusion.

222
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,025
Maybe you were dreaming.

223
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,989
How can you be sure that
it was an illusion created by a relic?

224
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,032
I saw it too.

225
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,790
It was an illusion disguised as Mu-deok.

226
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,115
All the relics that have the power
to create illusions are inside Jinyowon.

227
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,497
Let us go inside and check.

228
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,916
All right. I will open the door.

229
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,263
However, this place is filled
with dangerous relics and artifacts.

230
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,847
You could be possessed by sorcery
and be unable to return.

231
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,644
Young Master, it is too dangerous.

232
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,519
I will go with him.

233
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,273
As will I.

234
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,320
It sounds fun.

235
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,447
When will I get a chance
to enter Jinyowon again?

236
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,177
Go on inside.

237
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,807
I will give you an hour.

238
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,949
We should tell the leader.

239
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,118
Mu-deok.

240
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,340
Mu-deok!

241
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,883
So this is Jinyowon.

242
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,756
They say everything here is so precious.
Not a single one can be bought with money.

243
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,227
Will you please be quiet?
We are not here on a tour.

244
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,484
You are not the owner.

245
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,691
But I guess that could change
if you marry into the Jin family.

246
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,646
Lucky you.

247
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,404
All these precious treasures
will become yours, Jin Uk.

248
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,663
If you envy me so much,
you can marry into this family instead.

249
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,000
But even if you do become the owner,
how will you control anything?

250
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,329
You are a low-level mage.

251
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,753
If you are so great,
can you touch anything here?

252
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,625
The leader of Jinyowon told us
not to touch anything.

253
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,711
What an excuse.
You are just too scared to touch them.

254
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,060
-Damn it.
-What was that?

255
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,558
I do not know. What was that?

256
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,425
Are you all right?

257
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,595
Something odd must be in there.

258
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,186
Were you not startled?

259
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,780
I was startled.

260
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,783
It is dark in here, so be careful.

261
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,324
Was he really startled?

262
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,868
Yes. When Yul gets startled,
he loses his sense of direction.

263
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,162
Yul, do not go that way!

264
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,831
It is the other way.

265
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,631
We must go that way.

266
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,548
Let us all be careful.

267
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,181
Yul is always so calm,

268
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,346
but he can be a scatterbrain
when he is startled too.

269
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,021
I guess so.

270
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,188
Just make sure to be careful.

271
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,690
Be careful yourself.

272
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,613
Wait for me.

273
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,482
How did I get stuck in here?

274
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,714
I should have held it in.

275
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,383
I should not have provoked her.

276
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,876
I told you to be careful.

277
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,012
You wait here.
Young Master Jang will be here soon.

278
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,221
Young Lady Jin,
what is going to happen to me now?

279
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,392
What do you think?
You will be severely punished.

280
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,431
No, that is not what I am worried about.

281
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,227
They say whoever breaks
the yin-and-yang jade

282
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,061
will never have
a long-lasting relationship.

283
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,938
What am I going to do now?

284
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,991
What do you mean?

285
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,411
Stop talking nonsense.

286
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,282
If you break the yin-and-yang jade,

287
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,407
they say the person you love
will never love you back.

288
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,917
I heard all the gisaengs
at Chwiseonru saying that.

289
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,498
Is that true?

290
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,714
Yes.

291
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:45,168
Did you not know that, Young Lady Jin?

292
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,339
That cannot be.

293
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,509
Then what is going to happen to me?

294
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,885
Why are you worried

295
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,352
when I was the one who broke it?

296
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,777
You broke the jade, did you not?

297
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,775
You made me carry it
so you could blame it on me.

298
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,617
Am I right?

299
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,448
If you felt so wronged, you should have
said something to my mother.

300
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,422
Had I humiliated her daughter
in front of everyone,

301
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,378
she would not have forgiven me.

302
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,251
I am not scared of you,

303
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,471
but I am scared of your mother,
the leader of Jinyowon.

304
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,261
Are you that afraid of your mother?

305
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,767
It is true that I fear my mother,
but I hate you just as much.

306
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,943
I will sell you.

307
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,231
Like you said, my mother is a scary woman.

308
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,694
You will get sold
as punishment for having broken the jade.

309
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,486
To place far away!

310
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,401
Did she run away?

311
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,147
Should I try climbing over this wall?

312
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,766
How did she open the door to Jinyowon?

313
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,989
So this is Jinyowon.

314
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:02,115
If she gets locked inside, she might die.

315
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,068
Hey.

316
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,824
So it is you.

317
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,536
It has been a long time.

318
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,193
You cannot leave.

319
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,443
It will not break.

320
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,609
Nothing will work!

321
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,987
Be quiet.

322
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,932
Could she have died since she is
incapable of practicing spells?

323
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,973
If they saw her as an illusion…

324
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,137
Young Lady Jin.

325
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,313
Every time you move, I hear a sound.

326
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,320
It sounds…

327
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,067
like jade clinking against each other.

328
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,080
Mu-deok!

329
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,641
The hour is up. We must leave.

330
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,010
I am not going. I must find her.

331
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,477
This place is too big and deep.
The three of us cannot find her here.

332
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,809
You only came in here for a tour,
so you may go ahead and leave.

333
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,479
How did you see an illusion of Mu-deok?

334
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,315
I do not know where it came from.

335
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,029
But…

336
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,450
I came because you kept longing for me.

337
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,624
That is right.

338
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,872
She said that to me too.

339
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,996
That she came because I thought of her.

340
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,830
So her illusion comes to see you
if you think about her?

341
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,835
I guess you did not see it.

342
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,094
She visited me and Yul,

343
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,762
but she did not visit you
even though you are her owner.

344
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,641
Why in the world
were you thinking about Mu-deok?

345
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,675
I was drinking cinnamon and ginger wine.

346
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,767
Were you the one who got her drunk
and made her reek of cinnamon?

347
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,813
That is correct.

348
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,774
I also gave her a sachet that day.

349
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,687
The smell of cinnamon
probably came from the sachet.

350
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,954
Oh, you mean the sachet

351
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,408
that she hung by the outhouse
to get rid of flies?

352
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,485
"By the outhouse"?

353
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,866
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.
It really helped shoo away the flies.

354
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,330
Yul, what were you doing
when you saw her illusion?

355
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,344
The mirror.

356
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,091
-My mirror broke.
-So did the one in my room.

357
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,758
Did it come from the mirror?

358
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,269
A mirror?

359
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,767
Could this be it?

360
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,164
That is not you. It is fake.

361
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,445
It is an illusion.

362
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,842
So it was you.

363
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,719
She is trapped inside the mirror?

364
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,812
Yes.

365
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,982
We cannot see what is inside,
but we are sure she is in there.

366
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,855
She was sucked into the Mirror of Longing.

367
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,273
"The Mirror of Longing"?

368
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,737
It is a relic that creates illusions.

369
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,700
It uses other mirrors

370
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,358
to show illusions of things
that people long for.

371
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,197
She knows no spells,
so she probably got sucked inside

372
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,655
while she was in front of it.

373
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,711
We need to get Mu-deok out of the mirror.

374
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,250
Our spells will not work
because the energy in there is too strong.

375
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,460
Please take the Mirror of Longing
out of Jinyowon.

376
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,666
That cannot be done.

377
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,969
That relic swallowed a human.

378
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,013
It is too dangerous to take it outside.

379
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,273
I order you as the Crown Prince.

380
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,480
Take out the Mirror of Longing.

381
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,727
The Unanimous Assembly has granted us
a plaque to protect Jinyowon

382
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,935
from a situation like this.

383
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,162
I cannot take it out
even if it is the King's orders.

384
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,503
Uk will not leave…

385
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,963
without Mu-deok.

386
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,499
Then he will have to stay inside.

387
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,714
Once the hour is over,

388
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,665
I am going to seal this door.

389
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,720
Mother.

390
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,603
I found the yin-and-yang jade.

391
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,982
Mu-deok must not have stolen it.

392
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,558
Now that I found the jade,

393
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,145
please take out the Mirror of Longing
and get Mu-deok out of there.

394
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,941
Young Master Jang will die
if he gets locked inside.

395
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,824
Stay out of this.

396
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,869
Once the agreed time is over,
I shall seal the door.

397
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,089
Do not waste your energy.

398
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,264
You know you do not have
the power to break it.

399
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,263
Shut it! You are nothing but an illusion.

400
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,845
That is right. I am an illusion.

401
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,929
An illusion that reflects who you are.

402
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,322
Humans are incapable
of seeing themselves with their own eyes.

403
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,780
The only way is
to see themselves through a mirror.

404
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,445
So the perception you have about yourself

405
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,244
is nothing but an illusion.

406
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,004
The same goes for how others perceive you.

407
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,875
They only see what they want to see
and create an illusion that suits them.

408
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,878
It is all just an illusion.

409
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,930
If what you say is true,

410
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,604
that means people
only see illusions and nothing else.

411
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,848
That is right.

412
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,733
I turn into what they want to see the most
and show it to them.

413
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,726
I shall do the same for you.

414
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,698
Give me your energy.

415
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,825
Then I will…

416
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,407
turn you into
the most perfect version of yourself.

417
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,205
But…

418
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,724
you need my reflection
to create that so-called illusion.

419
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,138
What?

420
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,510
If there is nothing to reflect,

421
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,930
a mirror becomes useless.

422
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,827
You are nothing but a piece of glass.

423
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,173
That is enough babbling from you.

424
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,586
Mu-deok!

425
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,335
Are you in there?

426
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,138
Mu-deok!

427
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,889
Uk.

428
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,680
Uk!

429
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,310
Uk, I am in here!

430
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,772
I found you.

431
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,817
The time is up.

432
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,661
Cho-yeon, seal that door.

433
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,833
Mother.

434
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,419
-Do it now.
-Please wait.

435
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,892
I would like to go inside.

436
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,306
If the relic cannot be brought outside,

437
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,770
I will go in there myself
and get her out of the Mirror of Longing.

438
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,943
How can I trust a high-level mage
to set foot in there?

439
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,323
Trust me.

440
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,688
I will not touch any other artifacts.

441
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,147
I am not sure if I can.

442
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,527
My trust was once broken
by a Songrim mage.

443
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,079
Have you ever allowed
a Songrim mage to enter Jinyowon?

444
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,709
If you want to save Jang Uk,

445
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,552
you will have to ask mages
from Jeongjingak to drag him out of there.

446
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,757
My lord.

447
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,013
We are running out of time.

448
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,926
Yul, I want you to go in there

449
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,274
and bring Uk out.

450
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:16,936
Mu-deok.

451
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,357
While you were gone,

452
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,243
I thought about…

453
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,240
what I could do

454
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,657
to keep you by my side.

455
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,828
If I become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,

456
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,423
you can be the Assistant Gwanju.

457
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,009
Why would I want that?

458
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,761
You said you did not want
to stay by my side as just a maid.

459
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,683
We cannot tell anyone
that you are my master.

460
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,313
But you can stay
if you become the Assistant Gwanju.

461
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,521
Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
keeping a soul shifter by his side?

462
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,689
You must be mad.

463
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,280
I thought about it
after I heard about my marriage.

464
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,239
"He finally has a way out."

465
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,083
"But how will I manage without him?"

466
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,747
I bet you thought that and felt lost.

467
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,340
But now that you are not here,

468
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,972
I feel just as lost.

469
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,056
Mu-deok.

470
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,440
I miss you.

471
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,185
Feign ignorance even if I get caught.

472
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,861
No one here will let that thing attack me.

473
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,907
Then do me a favor, Uk.

474
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,870
Take me up there.

475
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,374
Fine.

476
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,912
I will take you to the top of that tree.

477
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,700
Mu-deok.

478
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,198
What is happening?

479
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,663
She is here!

480
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,954
Who?

481
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,498
It is her, the blind girl!

482
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,712
It is the ice stone!

483
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,514
The mirror is going to shatter.

484
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,125
Step away.

485
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,913
Young Master.

486
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,656
Mu-deok.

487
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,081
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I am fine.

488
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,080
-Is Mu-deok all right as well?
-Of course.

489
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,896
I fell while bringing out
the yin-and-yang jade.

490
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,358
I think that was when the jade broke.

491
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,487
So you tried to blame a maid
for the already-broken jade.

492
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,578
And the Mirror of Longing?

493
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,709
It was next to me when I fell,

494
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,501
but I did not even touch it.

495
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,166
Uk is not strong enough
to break the Mirror of Longing.

496
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,549
Then I must have

497
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,802
harmed the mirror as I fell.

498
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,271
Did you also

499
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,978
lock Mu-deok inside Jinyowon?

500
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,691
I did seal the door,
but she walked inside herself.

501
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:51,533
Those who are not members
of the Jin family cannot open that door.

502
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,695
Are you saying Mu-deok opened it?

503
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,202
Then I must have

504
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,789
opened the door.

505
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,459
I just saw her go inside
and locked her in there out of anger.

506
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,166
I apologize.

507
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,092
I will tell everyone

508
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,593
to keep things quiet.

509
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,137
I shall also stay silent about this
to help you save face.

510
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,141
I am truly sorry.

511
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,323
Are you all right?

512
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,395
Can you still not see?

513
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,145
No.

514
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,987
I saw a really bright light
when the mirror broke.

515
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,155
I cannot seem to open my eyes.

516
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,373
We should cover your eyes then.

517
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,130
Here.

518
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,337
If you stare at the sun for too long,
you are not able to see for a while.

519
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,303
You will recover soon.

520
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,555
I am sorry for this.

521
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,600
You did nothing wrong.

522
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,982
Young Lady Jin is at fault.

523
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,485
Mu-deok, are you all right?

524
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,794
What are you doing here,
Young Master Park?

525
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,998
I came because I was worried.

526
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,002
I see you have hurt your eyes.

527
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,212
Young Master Seo, you came as well?

528
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,843
You should get treated at Sejukwon.
I will take you there right now.

529
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,835
The palace is near, so she can go there.

530
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,604
Your Royal Highness? You are here too?

531
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,852
I will take you to the royal clinic.

532
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,859
That is not necessary.

533
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,189
She was just blinded by the light.
She did not get hurt.

534
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,355
I know you did not plan any of this,
but they came here for you.

535
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,156
So you should apologize and thank them.

536
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,662
I apologize for troubling you.

537
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,829
Thank you all.

538
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,431
Young Master.

539
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,062
Let us go home.

540
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,206
After what happened today,

541
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,206
I do not know
if their marriage will proceed.

542
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,674
Did you hear what she said?

543
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,514
She was ready to seal the door
even though Young Master was inside.

544
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,263
How terrifying.

545
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,352
It makes me uneasy that he will live
with a mother-in-law like her.

546
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,509
She made that choice to protect Jinyowon.

547
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,265
When you have a lot to protect,

548
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,480
you sometimes have no choice
but to be heartless.

549
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,306
Then…

550
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,935
would you have done the same?

551
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,239
I would say you and I are pretty close.

552
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,741
What if I got locked inside?
Would you seal the door?

553
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,527
So heartlessly?

554
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,294
My goodness.

555
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,376
It seems like you would.

556
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,882
Even if it means I might die in there?

557
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,422
Do not put me in a difficult spot
over something

558
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,263
that has not even happened.

559
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,183
I am not even actually locked inside.

560
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,309
Does it hurt for you to lie and tell me

561
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,599
-that you will never seal the door?
-I cannot

562
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,650
lie to you.

563
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,766
Right.

564
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,856
That is what someone like you must do.

565
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,445
You should say hello to Young Master Jang.

566
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,907
No. I have nothing to say to him.

567
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,292
I cannot lie
and act like everything is fine.

568
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,174
Of course. Thank you for today.

569
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,594
Goodbye.

570
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,348
Maidservant Kim…

571
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,306
If I ever have to seal the door,

572
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,443
it would shatter my heart…

573
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,530
to pieces.

574
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,949
He is inflexible and slow-witted.

575
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,794
"How could I seal the door
if you are inside?"

576
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,382
Could you not have said that?

577
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,936
What you did was dangerous.

578
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,439
Entering Jinyowon

579
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,114
was recklessly childish
and stubborn of you.

580
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,783
Do not be so angry.

581
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,373
You may think I am pathetic,

582
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,580
but that is an illusion.

583
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,450
What?

584
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,707
The mirror I saw inside Jinyowon told me

585
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,170
that people only see

586
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,500
what they wish to see.

587
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,502
That it is an illusion.

588
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,758
Are you saying I see you as an illusion?

589
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,920
If not,

590
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,184
why do you not want me to do anything?

591
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,266
All my life, I tried so hard

592
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,647
to prove to everyone
that I was my father's son.

593
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,688
But…

594
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,230
you told me I was not.

595
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,275
Though it hurt, it got rid of my illusion.

596
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,494
But even after that,

597
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,739
why do you want me to stay as an illusion?

598
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,321
I do not care what you stay as.

599
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,328
I only wish for one thing.

600
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,790
And that is for you…

601
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,828
to be safe.

602
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,629
The illusion I tried so hard to prove
no longer exists.

603
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,335
So from now on,

604
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,354
I am going to try even harder

605
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,176
to find out who I really am

606
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,225
and what I must do from now on.

607
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,881
Can you see now?

608
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,760
Yes, I can see.

609
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,520
What?

610
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,901
I was told the mirror made illusions.

611
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,819
I am checking
if it is really you that I saved.

612
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,611
You did not save me.
I broke it and got out myself.

613
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,316
What?

614
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,164
When I was trapped inside the mirror,

615
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,083
I regained my power for a bit
just like how I did

616
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,909
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

617
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,211
I am sure I broke the mirror
with my own power.

618
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,869
So that was how you got out?

619
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,037
I was excited thinking it was me.

620
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,206
Not even close.

621
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,924
You should be grateful
that the mirror did not suck you in.

622
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,005
I even thought about that
because you were still inside.

623
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,631
What a futile idea.

624
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,045
It would not have traded you for me.

625
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,467
What if it did?
Then would it not have been futile?

626
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,926
Well, I would have survived.

627
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,346
And I would have died.

628
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,112
Listen to me, my pupil.
When there is no other way,

629
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,399
the best deal is
to sacrifice yourself and save me.

630
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,824
No way.

631
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,648
If I die, you should die too.

632
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,408
You cannot live on your own.

633
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,744
You have no other choice.

634
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:23,036
When you put your pupil in danger,
your life should be at risk too.

635
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,035
Fine. I will keep that in mind.

636
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,837
Then what will happen
to marrying the woman

637
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,629
who almost had your master killed?

638
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:36,132
Marrying her will
surely guarantee my safety.

639
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,764
But you almost lost your life,

640
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,179
so I should risk my life too.

641
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,568
This is a marriage of convenience.

642
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,242
So let us resolve our issues
after the wedding.

643
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,860
The reason you need
a son-in-law like me is that

644
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,277
I am the eldest of the Jang family

645
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,367
and the next potential Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan.

646
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,365
Our families will come together
and become stronger.

647
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,381
Yes. Because this is
a marriage of convenience,

648
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,628
we should be open
about our strengths and weaknesses.

649
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,921
Apparently, I am not the son
of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju, Jang Gang.

650
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,802
I do not care about such rumors.

651
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,095
But what if that rumor

652
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,349
turns out to be true?

653
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,192
Think about whether or not you are willing

654
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,821
to take that risk
and take me in as your son-in-law.

655
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,539
I see you still have
the binding bracelet on you.

656
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,591
Yes.

657
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,679
He is still impudent as ever.

658
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,734
Why did you decide to marry Cho-yeon off
without even discussing it with me?

659
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,237
Who are you to meddle
in our family matters?

660
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,449
Ho-gyeong.

661
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,073
I am also a member of the Jin family.

662
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:28,455
The surname "Jin" is only given to those
with mothers from the Jin family.

663
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:33,416
My mother was a fool to have given
our family surname to someone

664
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,245
who my father begot out of wedlock.

665
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,883
You kicked me out as soon as you became
the leader of Jinyowon.

666
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,514
Do you still resent me that much?

667
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,715
I do not resent you.

668
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,387
I detest you.

669
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,062
I detest how treacherous you are.

670
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,112
The leader of Jinyowon should not
make decisions based on preference.

671
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,914
Choosing Jang Uk was the wrong decision.

672
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,410
Cancel the marriage.

673
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,702
What?

674
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,250
I will give you
a better card than Jang Uk.

675
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,378
How about the Crown Prince

676
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,839
as your son-in-law?

677
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,088
You want the Crown Prince
to marry into our family and live with us?

678
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,513
Cho-yeon is the second daughter.

679
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,135
Bu-yeon is the eldest
and will lead the family.

680
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,225
Her future husband will
move in with the family,

681
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,889
so it is unnecessary for Cho-yeon.

682
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,607
What are you scheming?
How dare you talk about Bu-yeon.

683
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,913
I know that your husband is
still looking for Bu-yeon.

684
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,204
As the Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,

685
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:53,076
I will do everything in my power
to help you find the daughter

686
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,172
you hopelessly long for.

687
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,922
I will make Bu-yeon the leader of Jinyowon
and make Cho-yeon become the queen.

688
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,006
So please

689
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,930
do not have her marry Uk.

690
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,719
I, your brother,

691
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,931
will become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
and give great support to Jinyowon.

692
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,483
After all, I am a member
of the Jin family.

693
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,662
Yul, there is something I find quite odd.

694
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,372
Why were you thinking about Mu-deok?

695
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,419
I was not thinking about Mu-deok.

696
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,417
I also do not understand
why that illusion showed up as Mu-deok

697
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,224
-and said those things.
-What did it say?

698
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,138
Hey, Yul.

699
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,599
We have to go this way.

700
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,971
Why do you keep wandering?
What startled you?

701
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,015
I will be all right.

702
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,278
Oh, dear.

703
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,909
Delivery packages.

704
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:12,906
Young Lady Jin's marriage gifts will
probably get delivered to Songrim today.

705
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,583
It is best that no one sees them.

706
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,124
I should keep them safe.

707
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,556
The bird! Catch the bird!

708
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,930
-Oh, gosh!
-Run!

709
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,980
-Darn it.
-Where did it fly to?

710
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,194
-Come on.
-It is over there!

711
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,822
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

712
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,935
-Hey.
-Over there!

713
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,983
Naksu has the ability to shift souls.

714
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,145
If Naksu shifted souls,
she is probably still alive somewhere.

715
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,124
You were longing for
the one you met at Danhyanggok.

716
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,713
Continue to think about her like that.

717
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,790
Then I will come to see you.

718
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:50,179
It is actually warmer than you think.

719
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:54,466
The snow quickly melts in the sunny spots.

720
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,903
So Mu-deok…

721
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,519
was Naksu.

722
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,957
You were the one
who left this at Danhyanggok.

723
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,642
So you are alive, Naksu.

724
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,157
Mu-deok.

725
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,405
I waited ages for you.

726
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,619
Did Maidservant Kim not tell you?

727
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,248
You should have come by noon.

728
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,958
Let us hurry. We must get
to Danhyanggok before the sun sets.

729
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,377
Instead of Danhyanggok,

730
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,836
let us go somewhere else.

731
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,102
Where?

732
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,729
There is an empty temple
by the bamboo forest in the east.

733
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,435
We can go there.

734
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,989
Bring Jang Uk here tonight.

735
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,608
Then I shall spare your life.

736
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,291
I must hand you over so I can live.

737
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,288
It is what must be done.

738
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,542
The marriage will not happen.

739
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,553
I gave them an excuse to discard me.

740
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,634
I see.

741
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,421
But…

742
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,314
Maidservant Kim had already received
the yin-and-yang jade.

743
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,682
So I made something out of it.

744
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,856
-They are bird's eggs.
-Yes.

745
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,985
Pick one. We can have one each.

746
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,237
We have quite a peculiar relationship.

747
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,035
A young master and a maid.
A master and a pupil.

748
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,829
So I figured they could act
as a token to remind us

749
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,496
to stay loyal and dutiful.

750
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,462
I will choose first.

751
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,376
I pick red. You can have the blue one.

752
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:25,811
Master, let us stay loyal
and dutiful to each other.

753
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,824
-Uk.
-Yes?

754
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,990
This is where we say goodbye.

755
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,326
I will return to where I came from.

756
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:50,498
-But they abandoned you.
-I met them again today.

757
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,634
They know who I am.

758
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,209
They asked me to come back.

759
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:58,134
-I thought they were dangerous.
-As you can see, I am alive.

760
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,126
If they wanted to kill me,
they would have already.

761
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:05,851
If I go back,
I will be able to regain my energy.

762
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,943
I promised to do that for you…

763
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,652
I told you that
I would stand on a cliff and push you.

764
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:22,110
I admit that I overtrained you every time,

765
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,368
and you did your best.

766
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,121
-We can keep doing that.
-No.

767
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:32,253
If we stay together, you will die,

768
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,579
and I will get caught.

769
01:02:55,897 --> 01:03:00,067
What brings the leader of Songrim
to secretly come all the way here?

770
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,611
I have something to ask you

771
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,318
about a Cheonbugwan mage
named Cho Chung from 20 years ago.

772
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,536
Naksu's father, Cho Chung,

773
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,627
was a soul shifter.

774
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,587
When we found him,

775
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,337
he had already run wild

776
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:26,343
and killed everyone in his family.

777
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,439
The four families had to get involved

778
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,765
to stop any further killings.

779
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,872
Naksu's father was also a soul shifter?

780
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,203
In the eyes of a child,

781
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,794
we probably seemed like murderers
for having killed her father.

782
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:59,088
She must have thought
her father was murdered by us.

783
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,457
That is probably why she came
to Songrim as an assassin.

784
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:07,677
What is the important matter
that you wanted to talk about?

785
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,560
Do you recall anything about Naksu?

786
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,897
If we meet again, I will kill you.

787
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,864
Are you implying that

788
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:28,244
I took in Cho Chung's daughter
and trained her to become an assassin?

789
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:31,622
You burned her body
as soon as it was found.

790
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,701
Was that not because you did not want
her identity to get revealed?

791
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:40,424
I will tell you what happened 20 years ago
instead of saying what you wish to hear.

792
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,966
Here, at Cheonbugwan, we record stars

793
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,298
from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.,
when energy is the highest.

794
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,927
The Gwanju checks it at noon,
and the recorded plate gets stored here.

795
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:59,267
But one day, a constellation plate
recorded that morning disappeared.

796
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:04,572
Fortunately, we were able
to find it again.

797
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,864
What about that?

798
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:17,581
It was the day Jang Gang's wife,
Do-hwa, died and Jang Uk was born.

799
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,788
Cho Chung recorded the stars that day,

800
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,415
and I was the one
who found the missing plate.

801
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,226
I have managed to sneak out
the actual plate.

802
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:44,612
The one in Cheonbugwan is
a fake one without the King's Star.

803
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,776
Are you telling me

804
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,914
that you know what happened

805
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,994
on the day that Jang Gang's son,

806
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,251
Jang Uk, was born?

807
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:07,174
A star that could change the world
appeared in the sky.

808
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:15,013
You knew about the King's Star?

809
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,966
Do you think things stayed quiet
thanks to Cho Chung's death?

810
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,978
Who do you think turned him
into a soul shifter in the first place?

811
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:28,783
Do not ask questions
you do not wish to hear the answers to.

812
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:32,029
That is the only way
to protect Songrim and its people.

813
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,004
The Danju does not know
that you are still alive, Naksu.

814
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,380
I did not tell him.

815
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,676
Bring Jang Uk.

816
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,719
Then my lips will stay sealed.

817
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,726
I shall shift my soul into his body.

818
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,576
Where is Jang Uk?

819
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,753
He will be here soon.

820
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,013
What brings you here at such a late hour?

821
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,971
Before Uk was born…

822
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,348
About 20 years ago…

823
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:44,734
Did Jang Gang

824
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,058
master a type of sorcery?

825
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,780
Did Jang Gang

826
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,108
perform the alchemy of souls?

827
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,047
What is taking him so long?

828
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,010
It is finally raining.

829
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,259
He should be here now.

830
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:25,888
Did you fool me?

831
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,269
Why are you stalling?

832
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:34,896
Seeing that the Danju
still has not shown up,

833
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:37,565
you really must be
the only one who knows about me.

834
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,571
You little…

835
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,314
Our journey stops here.

836
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:10,562
What about the empty temple by the forest?

837
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,861
Why were you going to take me there?

838
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,032
I was going to hand you over
so I could live.

839
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,913
Now you know, so do not follow me.

840
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,487
Then you should not have told me
about the temple.

841
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,753
How could I not follow you

842
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,539
after hearing what you just said?

843
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,304
I am more upset than you are.

844
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,919
I gave up my chance to live
just because of a bird's egg.

845
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,127
I am glad I reminded you
to be loyal and dutiful.

846
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,757
I could have actually died.

847
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,731
Now that I have helped you escape death,

848
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,096
fight like your life depends on it,
my pupil.

849
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,858
You make it sound like you saved my life.

850
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,029
If the cloudy sky blesses us with rain,

851
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,737
then we both might be able to live.

852
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,291
You really are one lucky fellow, Uk.

853
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,585
It is raining cats and dogs.

854
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,724
Do you not think my opponent
is a bit too strong?

855
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,586
He is a Cheonbugwan mage.

856
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:24,256
Hi. You remember me, right?

857
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:40,690
It is time. Use Tansu.

858
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,073
Instead of trying to flick the waterdrops
with your uncontrollable sword,

859
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,451
wield the sword
so that waterdrops fall onto it.

860
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:45,796
No.

861
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,798
What is that?

862
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:51,844
The alchemy of souls.

863
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,443
Is my soul…

864
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,523
being shifted right now?

865
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,424
Jang Uk!

866
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:15,467
So you have shifted souls
with my pupil, Gil-ju.

867
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,102
I think Uk fell victim
to the alchemy of souls.

868
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,100
What?

869
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,681
Was the man who shifted my father's soul

870
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,887
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan?

871
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,438
Why is it you again?

872
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,694
Are you certain that
the ice stone was indeed destroyed?

873
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,659
Order all of our mages to look for Gil-ju.

874
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:37,158
It must never be revealed
that they are soul shifters.

875
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:44,211
