1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,707
My lady, you must stay strong.

2
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,542
You must stay awake.

3
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,837
Please stay strong.

4
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,266
I SHALL MAKE DO-HWA MINE
IF SHE BEARS A CHILD, KNOW THAT IT IS MINE

5
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,349
Thanks to you,

6
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,272
the past seven days have been wonderful.

7
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,695
Do-hwa will be giving birth

8
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,990
to my son soon.

9
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,539
Your Majesty.

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,044
Do you remember the divination I received
on the day of my coronation?

11
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,134
You said I would be granted a son

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,960
who had the energy of the King's Star.

13
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,218
The divination was incorrect.
That cannot be.

14
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,889
No.

15
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,062
What you said has to be true.

16
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,191
I will have a son
thanks to your alchemy of souls.

17
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,692
Remember that.

18
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,782
Do-hwa will bear

19
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,157
my son.

20
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,542
He will be mine.

21
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,642
The star at the center of the Big Dipper
that contains nature's secrets

22
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:07,354
only reveals itself when the sky is filled
with the energy of the Daeho waters.

23
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,201
And my son will be born
when that star appears.

24
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,963
From this moment forward,
I hereby banish Jang Uk from Songrim.

25
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,626
There is one more left.

26
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,094
As for the last one,
you should do it yourself.

27
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,071
Mu-deok.

28
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,697
Is Young Master still not talking?

29
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,698
No. His back was flogged,
but it seems his mouth was as well.

30
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,204
He cries in pain even when
he bumps his fingers into something.

31
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,956
But he is being silent
after being flogged 100 times.

32
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,119
I am truly worried.

33
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,287
He is a crybaby, so I am guessing
it is still bearable for him.

34
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,761
His back is not what is paining him.
It is his heart.

35
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,803
He was cast away by the man
he considered a father figure.

36
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,427
Imagine how he feels.

37
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,555
He must think he was abandoned.

38
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,462
You should be happy you got flogged.

39
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,338
They will not be able to retrieve
the torrent of energy right away.

40
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,342
You will have more time to train.

41
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,481
Young Master.

42
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,312
Are you all right?

43
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,754
Mu-deok, look at this.

44
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,125
I think I used my energy
to make these ripples.

45
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,387
The water is just rippling.

46
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,885
Why is it not working? I have been
practicing my breathing technique.

47
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,313
Is that what
you have been doing in silence?

48
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,602
I thought you were wallowing in sadness
for being abandoned.

49
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,267
-I was wrong.
-Wallowing in sadness?

50
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,356
I was abandoned
from the moment I was born.

51
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,692
And this is not my first time
getting kicked out.

52
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,238
It does not faze me.

53
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,535
Just wait and see.

54
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,040
I will make them beg me
to come back to Songrim.

55
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,128
I guess being stupid
can be helpful at times.

56
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,710
I am acting with vigor.

57
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,090
By the way, why is it so hot in here?

58
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,598
Hot? I am cold.

59
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,138
Why did the water become so hot?

60
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,977
Why are you burning up?

61
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,688
I feel strange.
I think my body is getting hotter.

62
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,105
It is the energy.

63
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,446
But this soon?

64
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,913
It was the flogging.

65
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,161
It caused the torrent of energy
to surge faster.

66
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,581
I am glad you got flogged.

67
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,249
Mu-deok, I am burning up.

68
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,674
You will burn up once the torrent
of energy transforms into heat.

69
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,884
Then you will feel chilly
when it becomes cold.

70
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,585
That energy will be yours
only if you can bear that.

71
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,560
Keep breathing slowly.

72
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,806
This is cold water.

73
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,624
Mu-deok.

74
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,041
Is Young Master still bathing?

75
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,083
It has been almost an hour.

76
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,880
If she finds out, she will tell Songrim.
Then we will lose the torrent of energy.

77
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,843
Medicinal herbs.

78
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,632
He is bathing in medicinal herbs.

79
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,928
I have dissolved some medicinal herbs

80
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,852
and let him bathe in them
to treat his wounds.

81
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:55,929
Is that so?

82
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,560
Good thinking.

83
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,727
Hold on.

84
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,736
Then why is the water cold?

85
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,034
Sorry?

86
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,077
The water must have cooled down
in the past hour.

87
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,082
So why are you not bringing him hot water?

88
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,251
Is he running a fever?

89
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,246
Young Master.

90
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,468
That is so cold.

91
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,758
How could you let this happen?

92
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,306
What if he catches a cold?

93
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,066
The boiling hot water became ice-cold.

94
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,229
Young Master.

95
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,067
Where did he go?

96
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,856
Goodness.

97
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,285
Young Master, are you all right?

98
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,205
Yes.

99
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,538
Bathing in medicinal herbs
has made me relaxed but drowsy.

100
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,876
Come on, now. Go on and make his bed.

101
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,473
It is the cold. His body is freezing now.

102
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,773
I am freezing.
I think I am covered in ice.

103
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,397
It is the cold. Your energy
is surging faster than I thought.

104
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,820
Keep breathing.

105
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,970
I am freezing. I think I might faint.

106
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,270
Fight it. You must.

107
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,193
Jang Uk! Stay alert.

108
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,061
You could freeze to death
if you fall asleep now.

109
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,268
Get up.

110
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,068
Keep breathing.

111
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,539
Uncle, Yul and I
are the only friends Uk has.

112
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,126
He has nowhere but Songrim to call home.

113
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,011
Please let him return to Songrim.

114
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,799
He will not be able to train anyway.

115
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,970
No one will take him in

116
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,352
once they find out
he has been ousted from Songrim.

117
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,769
Stop talking about Uk.

118
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,099
I want you to focus
on the soul shifter case from now on.

119
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,244
He has completely hardened like stone.

120
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,911
He has been petrified.

121
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,790
A soul shifter who has run wild

122
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,001
replaces their lost energy
by absorbing that of a human.

123
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,301
He is no different from an evil spirit.

124
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,009
I can see why you forbid this sorcery.

125
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,970
The alchemy of souls
was not a type of sorcery from the start.

126
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,181
You can only perform this

127
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,681
once you have mastered Jipsu, Ryusu,
Chisu, and ultimately, Hwansu.

128
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,265
Hwansu is the godlike power

129
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,770
of changing water
to fire and vice versa. Is it not?

130
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,063
-Humans cannot reach that level.
-Right.

131
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,727
But Master Seo Gyeong,
the founder of Songrim, did.

132
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,567
There was also someone else.

133
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,692
Who?

134
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,698
As if you would know his name.

135
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,826
Who dared to perform the alchemy of souls

136
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,579
on this poor Songrim pupil?

137
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,372
He was meant to work at Cheonbugwan
and record the constellations.

138
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,707
He had been frequenting
the place for a few months.

139
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,207
Right. They were the ones
who caught Naksu's men

140
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,716
whom we had failed to catch
as if they had been waiting.

141
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,219
I am certain that
they have something to do

142
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,431
with this soul shifter case.

143
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,179
Yul and Dang-gu,
keep an eye on Cheonbugwan

144
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,097
and see if there is anything strange.

145
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,556
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

146
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,654
What is wrong with that?

147
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,032
It has been malfunctioning
ever since Uk broke it.

148
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,159
-Jang Uk…
-Do not move!

149
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,074
It will crumble.

150
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,833
Do not move.

151
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,122
Wait until the door completely shuts.

152
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,076
Jang Uk!

153
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,504
I told you not to move!

154
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,336
Help me!

155
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,585
Stay still.

156
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,007
Jang Uk…

157
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,253
Stay down for a moment.

158
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,063
Sapsali.

159
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,234
Come out.

160
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,651
Come with me.

161
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,953
I am glad you are back.

162
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,867
I will reward you with delicious treats
if you find the soul shifters.

163
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,455
I hope we get along.

164
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,783
Mu-deok.

165
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,366
If I freeze to death,

166
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,621
take the torrent of energy…

167
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,920
within me if you can.

168
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,088
If I could, I would have killed you
and done that already.

169
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,666
I am freezing to death here.

170
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,259
Do not say such coldhearted things.

171
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,773
Say something heartwarming.

172
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,429
Have you finally gone mad?

173
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,807
What is with you?

174
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,729
Jang Uk. Open your eyes.

175
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,446
Fine. I will say something heartwarming.

176
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,826
There was a huge tree
where I used to live.

177
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,616
And there was a bird's nest on top.

178
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,041
The egg inside it was warm.

179
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,924
Did you eat it?

180
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,922
I said this would be heartwarming.

181
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,974
The mother bird always came by
and sat on the egg.

182
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,856
I am the egg
that is at the top of the tree.

183
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,857
I know no one…

184
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,661
and I am powerless.

185
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,419
You are the only one
who can take care of me.

186
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,710
My life…

187
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,835
is in your hands.

188
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,595
How heartwarming.

189
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,020
Keep going.

190
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,494
There was also a cave where I lived.

191
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,042
A bear cub was living inside…

192
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,436
You cannot even take out
your own father's sword.

193
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,276
How do you expect to learn spells?

194
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,490
No one in Daeho will be able
to go against your father

195
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,704
and open your gate of energy.

196
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,575
That was the fate given to you

197
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,170
by your father.

198
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,690
You are not ready yet.

199
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,445
To unsheathe a mage's sword,

200
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,162
you must master Ryusu and be able
to channel your energy outward.

201
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,161
You cannot do it just yet
since you cannot control your energy.

202
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,793
My father left this sword behind
when he abandoned me.

203
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,094
And I can only join Songrim
if I unsheathe it.

204
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,918
I want to unsheathe it and show them.

205
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,473
Is that an act of stupidity?

206
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,841
No, it is an act of vigor.

207
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,966
Stay strong, Jang Uk.

208
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,164
Your Royal Highness.

209
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,714
We have arrived at Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,
Jang Gang's house.

210
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,252
Young Master!

211
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,666
You have a guest.

212
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,302
Who is it?

213
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,643
The Crown Prince has come to see you.

214
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,832
This is the perfect weather

215
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,082
to go fishing with Uk
by Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

216
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,957
I wonder if he has recovered
from the flogging.

217
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,626
I am going to see him since I am worried.

218
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,375
But why are you tagging along?

219
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,181
I need to check something.

220
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,391
There is something I told his maid.

221
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,312
I see.

222
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,019
I understand that
we are visiting him as friends.

223
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,690
But why are you here?

224
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,941
I just happened to run into you.

225
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,692
And I had something
to nitpick him about. That is why.

226
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,316
I see. You are going to nitpick.

227
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,454
What is in that bundle?

228
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,485
It is medicine to treat his wounds.

229
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,826
I see. You are going to give him
some medicine before nitpicking at him.

230
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,341
I see. How incredible.

231
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,549
You are here for Naksu's sword?

232
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,551
The King has entrusted
Cheonbugwan with it.

233
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,300
Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju,
should take it since the Gwanju is absent.

234
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,306
Since you came here yourself,
I will hand it over to you.

235
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,484
You can take it.

236
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:12,944
Bring it here.

237
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,861
And one more thing.

238
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,988
There is another sword here
that you cannot unsheathe.

239
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,164
The late king had bestowed it
on Gwanju Jang Gang.

240
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,373
I would like to take that as well.

241
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,251
But that belongs to his father.

242
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,665
He has the right to keep it.

243
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,288
He was never entrusted with it.

244
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,878
I heard Songrim had kept it all this time.

245
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,882
You only took it
after being kicked out, did you not?

246
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:45,101
The royal palace will keep it
until a new Gwanju is instated.

247
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,060
Bring it to me.

248
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,897
I cannot.

249
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:02,315
As you already know,
no one acknowledges him as my father.

250
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,624
It will not bode well for me
if I lose that sword as well.

251
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,253
I will keep it, even if it means
using it as decoration.

252
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,924
I must take it with me,

253
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,958
but you refuse. It cannot be helped.

254
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,968
Whoever wins shall take the sword.

255
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,646
You are not fully trained
for a true fight.

256
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,695
If you can push me over this line,

257
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,578
I will leave.

258
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,934
I am sure you expected me
to grovel in humiliation.

259
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,608
Going against you would be
an act of stupidity.

260
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,318
However, there is someone
who sees it as one of vigor.

261
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,439
So I shall try.

262
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,159
It is the energy.

263
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,537
It was the flogging.

264
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,673
It caused the torrent of energy
to surge faster.

265
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,543
I am glad you got flogged.

266
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,880
All right. You can hit me
as much as you want.

267
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,302
Step back!

268
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,671
Step back! This is from the chamber pots!

269
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,600
What did you just do?

270
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:05,901
Who is she?

271
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,145
-I serve this young master.
-How dare a maid intervene?

272
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,283
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

273
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,025
My maid was impudent.

274
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,539
What is this?

275
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,791
That is disgusting.

276
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,875
You should return home and get changed.

277
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,548
-What?
-You stepped over the line.

278
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,553
You may have stepped back
to avoid the filthy water,

279
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,796
but you still lost.

280
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,267
Please keep your word
and let me have my father's sword.

281
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,807
As you can see,

282
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,443
I am afraid I cannot see you out
since I am heavily injured.

283
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,454
What is going on?

284
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,658
All right.

285
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,581
I will keep my promise
and let you have it.

286
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,285
However,

287
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,910
I must punish her.

288
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,707
I will not forgive her
for tainting my clothes.

289
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,139
I unsheathed this sword…

290
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,909
Jang Uk!

291
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,582
I thought you did not know
how to use spells,

292
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,412
but you have been deceiving us all.

293
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:28,827
That is not…

294
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,537
What?

295
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,053
You!

296
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,425
How dare you point
the sword at the Crown Prince?

297
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,682
-No, it was not me.
-Uk! Put that down!

298
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,892
-Put it down right now!
-I want to!

299
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,476
But I cannot!

300
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,996
Stop it this instant!

301
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,173
I have no control!

302
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,642
Jang Uk.

303
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,904
Die!

304
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,821
Please stop.

305
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,287
-Stop it.
-This is weird. I cannot control my arm.

306
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,705
What?

307
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,128
I did not mean to do that…

308
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,011
Goodness! Young Master!

309
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,549
Oh, dear!

310
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,015
It is a binding bracelet.

311
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,769
Its weight will keep
your arm under control.

312
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,820
His energy overflowed into one arm
and made it uncontrollable.

313
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,617
Unbind him!

314
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,199
Jang Uk.

315
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,406
Grab your sword.

316
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,583
Your Royal Highness.

317
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,666
He is no match for you.

318
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,341
Did you not just witness it all?

319
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,959
He unsheathed his father's sword
and pointed it at me.

320
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,587
He just failed to control his energy.

321
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,175
-As you can see, he even hit me.
-Shut it!

322
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,769
Your Royal Highness,
you wielded your sword at him first.

323
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,389
The sword you swung in anger broke.

324
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,896
You should abide
by the mages' customs and return home.

325
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,993
How dare you stand
against the Crown Prince?

326
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,034
Jang, Jin, Seo, and Park.
All four of you are before me.

327
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,580
I refuse to go home defeated.

328
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,831
What will you do?

329
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,830
Join hands and come at me.

330
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,512
This is not looking good.

331
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,603
It will look like our families
are up against the royalty.

332
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,599
This is getting pretty serious.

333
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,271
Cho-yeon provoked him.

334
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,019
What did I do?

335
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,400
Then let us just hand Uk over.

336
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,559
Your Royal Highness.

337
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,693
They are the four heirs of Daeho.

338
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,738
The King will be furious

339
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,399
if he hears of this fight.

340
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,236
Then what? Should I just leave?

341
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,541
You should have stopped me
before I started.

342
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,635
Mu-deok, you…

343
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,771
I am terribly sorry, Your Royal Highness.

344
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,146
How dare a lowly brat like me
splash filthy chamber pot water

345
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,482
on your precious clothes?

346
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,946
I am sorry. I truly am.

347
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,163
Go away.

348
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,542
Get lost. You reek. Go.

349
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,919
Please forgive us.

350
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,552
As a token of my apology,
I will drink the rest of this.

351
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,716
So please forgive us.

352
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,647
Mu-deok!

353
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,112
Why on earth would you drink that?

354
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,821
Young Master!

355
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,624
I should be the one drinking it.

356
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,834
What?

357
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,212
That is not true.

358
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,130
Why would you drink this?

359
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,709
I am the cause of all this, so I should.

360
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,625
You got it all wrong.
His Royal Highness is upset at me.

361
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,755
So I ought to drink it.

362
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,387
There is quite a lot.

363
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,893
Just give it to me. I will drink it.

364
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,096
Then should we share it?

365
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,647
Why would we share drinking
this filthy water?

366
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,071
What?

367
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,229
You can have it all.

368
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,530
Then I will drink some and hand it to you.

369
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,322
Help me hold it up
since I cannot use my right arm.

370
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,157
Young Master!

371
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,253
I will drink…

372
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,462
I will drink it.

373
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,589
Forget it.

374
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,552
Why would you drink this?

375
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,762
Just go.

376
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,092
Exactly how much is there?

377
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,798
Do you want me to help out too?

378
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,720
-Really?
-Give it to me.

379
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,484
It really is chamber pot water.

380
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,067
Your Royal Highness.

381
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,150
How could we possibly
dare to challenge you?

382
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,281
Must you let them drink

383
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,622
that filthy water solely as an apology?

384
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,373
Damn it.

385
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,706
Forget it. You are making me retch.

386
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,338
Let us go.

387
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,468
His Royal Highness is leaving!
Bow before him!

388
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,640
By the way, why did he come here?

389
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,226
He came for Naksu's sword.

390
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,846
Then he suddenly picked a fight.

391
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,362
He may have left for today.
But given his temper,

392
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,528
he will retaliate for sure.

393
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,370
-Are you all right?
-He hit me so many times.

394
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,989
-Goodness.
-You hit me pretty hard.

395
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,164
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I think so.

396
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,498
-It hurts.
-Does it?

397
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,922
-Are you all right?
-It hurts.

398
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,590
-It hurts.
-Do not touch him!

399
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,378
Your Royal Highness!

400
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,636
What is that?

401
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,515
You came here
for Naksu's sword, so here it is.

402
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,475
That is right.

403
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,863
I had come here to retrieve that.

404
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,780
I brought it to you
so you will not have to come here again.

405
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,241
Please take it.

406
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,278
Are you telling me to take
what I came here for and never return?

407
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:05,584
You are truly intelligent and strong.

408
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,873
Are you teasing me since I lost?

409
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,787
Lost? You got what you came here for.

410
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,877
And he lost it.

411
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,972
You are the winner here.

412
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:22,047
She is right, Your Royal Highness.
You won.

413
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,099
Congratulations, Your Royal Highness.

414
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,475
Let us say that is the case.

415
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,610
You are truly generous as well.

416
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,652
There is no other man
who is as noble as you.

417
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,370
What is your name?

418
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,124
It is Mu-deok, Your Royal Highness.

419
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,289
Mu-deok.

420
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,630
Since you threw filthy water at me,

421
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,339
I will call you Filthy Mu-deok
from now on.

422
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,973
Just like your name,
you reek of filth right now.

423
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,347
You even gave me a name.

424
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,892
I am truly grateful for your kindness.

425
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,685
Goodbye, Your Royal Highness.

426
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,737
Let us go.

427
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,328
My pupil is still too weak
to fight against you.

428
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,085
Until he becomes stronger,
he should not get on your bad side.

429
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,008
You do not hesitate to fall in love
or brown-nose others

430
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,466
for your young master's sake.

431
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,135
I could not fight him myself,
so I splashed that on him.

432
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,023
I reek of filth. You should avoid me.

433
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:00,951
Wipe yourself.

434
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,293
How dare I dirty
the man I am in love with?

435
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,536
No, thank you.

436
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,529
I sure have become Filthy Mu-deok.

437
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,377
You should wash up
since you probably reek as well.

438
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,524
Master, I finally did it.

439
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,928
Gwigu was stolen from Jinyowon.

440
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,812
Only those from the Jin family
can open that door.

441
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,765
They must have summoned it out of there.

442
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,898
A burglary in Jinyowon?

443
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,149
You were heartbroken for years
after losing your eldest daughter.

444
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,613
You must have become weaker
over the years.

445
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,947
What an impudent brat.

446
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,992
You may be an illegitimate son,
but you are still part of the Jin family.

447
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,157
How dare you bad-mouth your half-sister?

448
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,366
How dare you?

449
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,745
I am the Assistant Gwanju.

450
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,462
I would appreciate it
if you showed more respect.

451
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,684
My lord, please come outside.
Jang Uk is here.

452
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,119
Did I not forbid him from entering here?

453
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,752
So why did you bring him with you?

454
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,455
There is something you should see.

455
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,554
This is my father's sword.

456
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,723
When I was young, you said
you would accept me if I unsheathed this.

457
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,349
Do you remember?

458
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,016
I thought he had just opened
his gate of energy.

459
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,726
I see he has absorbed
my torrent of energy.

460
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,476
Like father, like son.

461
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,685
He mastered Ryusu in the blink of an eye.

462
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,661
Please take me under your wing,

463
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,409
my lord.

464
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,865
What is that around your arm?

465
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,705
His energy is focused on his right arm.

466
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,081
He could not control it yet,

467
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,127
so it has been tied down
by the binding bracelet.

468
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,682
Take it off.

469
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,140
If we do, his arm will get out of control.

470
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,058
He should unbind it
after receiving more training.

471
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,227
Do it.

472
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:19,054
Let me see you hold your sword.

473
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,464
Bind his arm again.

474
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,901
Are you all right, my lord?

475
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,857
What is the point of unsheathing the sword

476
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,566
when you cannot even hold it?

477
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,661
He is just not able to control it for now.

478
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,913
But his power is incredible.

479
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,495
He even beat the Crown Prince with that.

480
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,919
He broke His Royal Highness' sword.

481
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,541
Despite having mastered Ryusu long ago,

482
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,168
he was defeated by Uk.

483
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,934
Cho-yeon, stop intervening.

484
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,473
Yes, Mother.

485
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:46,095
Uk, did you really fight the Crown Prince?

486
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,444
He did not start it first.

487
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,399
Did you fight him?

488
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,519
I did.

489
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,527
His Royal Highness wanted
to take the Gwanju's sword.

490
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,491
It was a bet, my lord.

491
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,157
Even the Crown Prince forgave him.

492
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,657
Despite his sword having broken,
Uk still threatened him with that sword!

493
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,576
He put the Crown Prince's life in danger.

494
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,666
We were there too.

495
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,883
We stopped him beforehand.

496
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,001
That means the four of you watched

497
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,258
as His Royal Highness was ridiculed.

498
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,717
This is an insult to the royal family!

499
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,523
Lock him up.

500
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,555
He is uncontrollable and dangerous.

501
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,767
Yes, my lord.

502
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,169
As soon as his gate of energy was opened,

503
00:45:56,253 --> 00:46:00,173
Jang Uk immediately wielded
his sword at the Crown Prince.

504
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,007
Cheonbugwan will not let this slide.

505
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,873
Have you still not received treatment?
You bled a lot.

506
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,615
How is your arm?

507
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,554
The binding bracelet hinders its movement.

508
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,629
But I am fine.

509
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,552
You managed to turn
Master Heo's torrent of energy into yours

510
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,135
in a short period of time.

511
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,514
I am truly impressed.

512
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,061
It felt like my body was on fire.

513
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,114
Then it felt like I was covered in ice.

514
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,106
What about the wounds from the flogging?

515
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,532
Are you still in pain?

516
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:50,413
It seems like the flogging
helped surge the energy.

517
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,499
The Crown Prince had landed many hits.

518
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,586
Then I felt a surge within me.

519
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,038
That is when I unsheathed it.

520
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,422
Right.

521
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:09,603
You were always
a quick learner compared to others.

522
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:14,602
You even learned to walk and run
sooner than Dang-gu did.

523
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,692
You could also talk before he could.

524
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,274
I still remember that.

525
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,534
When I did not know what it meant
to have a blocked gate of energy,

526
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,663
I thought I would become
the most powerful person.

527
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,286
Uk.

528
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,787
You are intelligent
and pick up things quickly.

529
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:47,585
How about you join our trade
and learn how to do business?

530
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:52,845
Or Master Heo can take you under his wing
and teach you the art of medicine.

531
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,693
No, my lord.

532
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,980
I am going to train in Jeongjingak
and become a mage.

533
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,741
Why?

534
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,414
Because that is what your father did?

535
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,494
Do you desire to become
the next Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?

536
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,911
Yes, my lord. And I will be.

537
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,628
I will take his place

538
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,748
and prove it to all those scumbags
who denied that I was his son.

539
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,258
-I will make them speechless.
-You…

540
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,967
are not

541
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,300
his son.

542
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,931
You are

543
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,853
the result of your mother's love affair.

544
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,320
To show our respect to your late mother,
we let you into the Jang family.

545
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,202
But we cannot allow you
to lead Cheonbugwan after your father.

546
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,409
So stop dreaming of becoming…

547
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,412
like your father.

548
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:03,211
Just stay a clueless Young Master

549
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,457
of the Jang family.

550
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,458
If you do,

551
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,296
we will continue to take care of you.

552
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,056
Then…

553
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,860
Then who is my real father?

554
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,489
How would anyone know
whom your late mother…

555
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,908
had an affair with?

556
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,162
Uk probably has a lot on his mind.
You should let him be.

557
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,751
Make sure he finishes his food.

558
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,429
Maidservant Kim told me to make sure
you finished your meal.

559
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,467
Did he scold you again?

560
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,350
I thought you were used to being scolded…

561
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,869
It was not me.

562
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,251
I do not think they have fixed the door
since that incident.

563
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,867
Do not move.

564
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,998
Just stay there.

565
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,796
It might all crumble down.

566
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,799
So just stay there.

567
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,702
Why did you not dodge his blade?

568
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,777
Was it because

569
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,741
you needed another reason to kick him out?

570
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,794
I deserve it.

571
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,460
After all, I broke his heart.

572
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:54,341
Breaking his heart must be more painful
than getting stabbed.

573
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,302
Maidservant Kim.

574
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:03,143
You said there were rumors
about how I was Uk's father, right?

575
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,600
What if I just said

576
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,346
that I was indeed his father?

577
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,359
I will step down from my position.

578
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,316
Then I will have my own little business

579
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,661
and do trading with Uk.

580
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,002
Songrim needs its leader.

581
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,579
Then how about I say

582
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,539
that I am his mother?

583
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,546
I think it would be better

584
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,089
if Uk and I went to the hometown
where Lady Do-hwa and I grew up.

585
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,303
That cannot happen.

586
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:50,441
Uk takes after Do-hwa. That is why

587
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,861
he is so good-looking.

588
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,150
Who would believe you…

589
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,033
if you said you were his mother?

590
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,238
Hold on.

591
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:07,872
Are you saying
he should be ugly if I was his mother?

592
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,250
In that case,
you cannot be his father either.

593
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,831
Of course, I can.

594
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,043
Jang Gang and I
have always been neck and neck…

595
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,718
when it came to our looks.

596
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:26,965
No, you lost.

597
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,095
You cannot hold a candle to him.

598
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:33,312
Do-hwa said she loved everything
about you except for your looks.

599
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,555
Do not put words in her mouth!

600
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,613
You did not even flinch
when you got stabbed.

601
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,992
But I guess hearing
that you are ugly is quite painful.

602
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,319
The pain

603
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,873
runs deep.

604
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,619
Does your wound hurt?

605
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,251
Stay still.
You will break open the wound again.

606
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,498
We share…

607
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,749
the same pain

608
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,844
of not having our feelings reciprocated

609
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,433
by the ones we loved.

610
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,336
So let us

611
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,005
not hurt each other.

612
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,387
I admit that I did not mean what I said.

613
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,847
You are…

614
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:18,981
good…

615
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,283
Good…

616
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,029
Good-looking.

617
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:32,448
You are also indeed

618
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,957
good…

619
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:39,292
Good-looking.

620
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,970
Let me tend to your wound.

621
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:51,848
It hurts.

622
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,234
Goodness.

623
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,938
A bit below.

624
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,560
That is right.

625
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:01,316
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

626
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,526
Jang Uk seems to be the owner

627
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,618
of the Spirit Plaque from Chwiseonru.

628
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:15,913
Jang Uk?

629
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,787
He was flogged recently
after losing Songrim's Spirit Plaque.

630
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,625
And I heard
his maid frequented this place.

631
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,473
That girl from Songrim is his maid.

632
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,847
And she was at the inn that day.

633
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,515
Could she be

634
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,477
Naksu?

635
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:45,694
Are we still far away from Cheonbugwan?

636
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,454
I think I will be petrified at this rate.

637
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,076
We will hurry. Please stay strong.

638
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,540
You must not run wild right now.

639
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,004
My lord, are you all right?

640
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,607
Let us just go back.

641
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:56,892
This arm of yours reached Ryusu

642
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,393
in that short period of time.

643
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,978
You sure are as bright as your father.

644
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,318
Jin Mu from Cheonbugwan

645
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:12,321
only picked a fight because he realized
he will never become the next Gwanju.

646
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,565
He has realized that you,

647
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,697
the eldest son of the Jang family,
would become the next Gwanju.

648
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,174
My uncle's wound was not that deep.

649
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,715
Do not worry about him.

650
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,258
I will have a word with Jin Mu.

651
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,394
All right?

652
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:42,944
Take good care of him.

653
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,341
You always put Uk in danger.

654
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,679
You were there when he was poisoned

655
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,601
and during the confrontation
with the Crown Prince.

656
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,398
So do you want to separate me from him?

657
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,688
I cannot do that.

658
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,244
He got what he wanted every time.

659
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,650
And you risked your life to save him.

660
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,197
This is his father's sword.

661
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,998
Take it with you.

662
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,493
I cannot tolerate this any longer.

663
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,240
How long will this pity party last?

664
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,413
Get up.

665
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,845
You received a powerful torrent of energy,
and it surged within you.

666
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,386
It took you merely ten days
when it would take ten years for others.

667
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,475
-If you keep training--
-Forget it.

668
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,980
I will not do it.

669
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,691
Have Park Jin's few words dispirited you?

670
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,532
So all this was just an act of stupidity.

671
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,491
No wonder you look so hopeless.
You are just too weak!

672
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:02,372
Yes, I am.
So I am not going to do anything.

673
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,910
So just be quiet.

674
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,333
Just shut up and do not bother me.

675
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,381
I do not need a pupil
who will not do anything.

676
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,299
Then do not be my master.

677
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,930
Just be my maid.

678
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,936
Annoy me again, and I will sell you off.

679
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,229
Young Master.

680
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:16,066
My young master is too troubled
and will not drink any water.

681
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,109
Can you please help?

682
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,782
What can I do?

683
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,275
It is best that my uncle resolves this.

684
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:25,623
Master Heo said he would step up.

685
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,410
Please ask him to meet with Jin Mu
and put an end to this immediately.

686
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,837
I came here today because I am concerned

687
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,341
that you exacerbated a trivial issue.

688
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:45,804
How could threatening
the Crown Prince be deemed trivial?

689
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,517
That is why our leader locked him away.

690
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,903
Songrim will give him
the punishment he deserves.

691
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,819
Songrim cannot punish him
when this concerns the royal family.

692
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:02,284
Since Cheonbugwan is in charge,
we will punish him here.

693
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,159
What will you do with him?

694
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:09,079
Since he threatened the Crown Prince,
he deserves to be beheaded.

695
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:15,167
However, we cannot kill
the Gwanju's one and only son.

696
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:19,673
So we ought to cut off the arm
that threatened the Crown Prince.

697
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,258
Cut off his arm?

698
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,880
It must have hurt your pride

699
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,216
that your pupil could not put up a fight

700
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:29,012
against Uk whose gate of energy
had only been open for ten days.

701
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,886
You fool, I was generous enough
to save you two's faces.

702
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,234
So I was going to be nice about this.

703
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,940
But you have gone insane.

704
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,770
Let Cheonbugwan determine
if it is me who is crazy or Jang Uk.

705
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,897
-You little--
-Master, please.

706
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,324
Their fight was consensual.

707
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,277
Uk's maid witnessed it all
from the beginning.

708
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,036
It was a fair fight.

709
01:03:56,249 --> 01:04:00,919
If you cannot believe us,
let them fight again.

710
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,764
Fight again? That is a good idea.

711
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,273
Since you claim
he was not threatening the Crown Prince

712
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,929
and that it was a fair fight,

713
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,770
how about we have an official duel?

714
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,687
A duel between the Crown Prince and Uk?

715
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,235
If you cannot do that, hand Uk over to us.

716
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,739
But if you accept this,

717
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:31,241
we will not ask anyone to take
responsibility even if someone dies.

718
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,498
As per the Daeho mages' customs.

719
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,223
We had come here to resolve it,
but look what we have done.

720
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:52,971
That sly snake got the better of me.

721
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,055
Uk will die if they have an official duel.
What should we do?

722
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,442
Do not worry.

723
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,848
The Crown Prince
will not take up the challenge.

724
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,478
Ever since Master Seo Gyeong
founded Songrim,

725
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,936
the royal family and the mages
have never dueled before.

726
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,528
Both sides have kept

727
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:13,493
this unspoken rule so they would not waste
their energy on each other.

728
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,156
There is no way

729
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,624
the Crown Prince
would break that and fight Uk.

730
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,342
Please take up the challenge.

731
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:34,719
I do not see why I need to go against
Songrim just because of that fool.

732
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:38,805
Thanks to them, they will not be able
to point their fingers at us.

733
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:43,193
Show Songrim exactly how strong you are.

734
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,424
They are royal guards
and Cheonbugwan's men.

735
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,173
What is going on?

736
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,797
Darn it, Master Heo.

737
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,551
He said nothing would happen.

738
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,295
What is all this?

739
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,719
What should we do with Uk?

740
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,564
I do not understand why they are here.

741
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:26,315
I was going to talk to you about it.

742
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,529
But Jin Mu beat me to it.

743
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,114
Jin Mu?

744
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,244
Did something happen again?

745
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,578
Darn it!

746
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,500
The Crown Prince

747
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:42,248
has challenged Jang Uk to a duel.

748
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,460
The Assistant Gwanju said
we should transfer Jang Uk to Cheonbugwan

749
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,966
if he refused the challenge.

750
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,469
Jang Uk is already locked up in here.

751
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:59,813
Transfer to Cheonbugwan?
What is this about?

752
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,600
Please ask Master Heo.

753
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,693
I was told
they had already agreed on this.

754
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,448
Uk, get up. You need to get out of here.

755
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,290
What is it?

756
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,748
There is no time to explain.
If you do not go, you will lose your arm.

757
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,424
No, you could even die.

758
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,290
-What?
-Young Master.

759
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,417
Things have gotten serious.

760
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:32,013
Stay here,
and you will lose an arm or your life.

761
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,509
Will you still do nothing?

762
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:50,403
I will go to the royal palace with Jang Uk
and meet with the Crown Prince.

763
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,943
Uk will be here soon.

764
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:58,491
Where is Uk?

765
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,834
He is not in the secret room.
I think he fled.

766
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:03,536
What?

767
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,171
When you are caught
between a rock and a hard place,

768
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,215
fleeing is your best bet.

769
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:26,102
He was here all along,
and only his maid came and went.

770
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,265
I do not understand how he fled.

771
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:32,858
Where are Yul and Dang-gu?

772
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,247
Our leader will take care of it.
Lie low until the dust settles.

773
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,330
Mu-deok, take good care of him.

774
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:53,251
By the way,
are you sure you do not need us to come?

775
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,837
Yes, we are going to my former village.

776
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,883
Sari Village, was it?

777
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,797
Stay there. We will come
to pick you up soon.

778
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,102
You have put him in danger once again.

779
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,726
And he will get what he wants once more.

780
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,351
The duel will take place

781
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:48,428
in the middle of next month.

782
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,226
But if

783
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,976
he does not show up on that day,

784
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,818
please accept that as his defeat.

785
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,364
That is fleeing, not losing.

786
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,120
I believe a coward like that
should be punished.

787
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,325
I agree with him.

788
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,247
If Jang Uk does not show up,

789
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,125
he will be deprived of his right to become

790
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,168
the next Gwanju.

791
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:29,347
I understand, Your Majesty.

792
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:49,041
Why bring that when we are fleeing?

793
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,791
Because you need to train.

794
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:53,082
Train?

795
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,455
Are we going there to train?

796
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,093
Were you behind everything?

797
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,629
I just played a part.

798
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,969
You finally budged
when I said you were in danger.

799
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,301
What is wrong?

800
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,466
I do not need a pupil
who does not improve.

801
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,854
Just die if you are
not going to do anything.

802
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,773
You have poisoned me again,

803
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,646
crazy master.

804
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:17,363
Jang Uk.

805
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:21,528
We will go to where I used to train.
Brace yourself.

806
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:25,612
There will be no warm baths,

807
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:30,288
cozy beds, or food
that is seasoned well to your liking.

808
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,424
Is Sari Village really that scary?

809
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,880
Sari Village was where Mu-deok was from.

810
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,921
Naksu's hometown

811
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:43,376
was Danhyanggok.

812
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,469
That is our destination.

813
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,742
Why are these things here?

814
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:46,949
Mu-deok!

815
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,029
I almost misunderstood you for trying
to kidnap and make me live with you

816
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:51,775
on the pretense of training me.

817
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,827
I will have you know
I can teach you in other ways too.

818
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,622
Those kinds of girls
are the most dangerous!

819
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,206
I do not enjoy sweet things.

820
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,501
Be my guest if you do not wish to eat.

821
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,915
-Yul is cooking rice with Mu-deok!
-I told you…

822
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:08,925
How could you teach someone else when your
pupil is standing right in front of you?

823
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:12,099
What if we disqualify Uk
of his rights as a mage?

824
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:15,059
No matter where he goes,
there will be no master for Uk.

825
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:18,310
A great soul has shifted into this body.

826
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,354
Mu-deok, run!

827
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:20,726
I wanted to do nothing…

828
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,313
But one thing keeps bothering me.

829
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:29,316
