1
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,512
I forbid anyone from opening
his gate of energy!

2
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,694
Wait!

3
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,113
You cannot just leave like this.

4
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,400
What about this child?

5
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:11,282
Think about what people will say
about Do-hwa and this baby.

6
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,661
They will say he is not your son

7
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,992
and call him an illegitimate child.

8
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,464
He will be raised by the Jang family
since my wife gave birth to him.

9
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,502
I will send someone over
after his mother's funeral.

10
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,044
Are you abandoning this child?

11
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,590
Is he really

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,880
not your son?

13
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,471
Believe what you wish to believe.

14
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,484
If this child is
only going to cause trouble,

15
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,308
let us just end his life here and now.

16
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,488
See? He is your son.

17
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:59,412
A son you are willing to protect
even at the risk of your own life.

18
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,754
I am merely trying to keep him safe.

19
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,786
If his gate of energy remains closed
and he lives as my son, he will live.

20
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,423
However, if he chooses
to discover his fate instead,

21
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,676
he will not survive.

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,260
Who is the father

23
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,852
of that child?

24
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,515
He is the son of a dead man.

25
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,105
Not only does his birth make no sense,

26
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,953
but it never should have happened either.

27
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,712
Young Master, are you all right?

28
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,825
Why did you bring her out?

29
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,166
Let her go.

30
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,161
I apologize for causing trouble.

31
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,410
Why did you bring her out?

32
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,117
She tried to poison you.

33
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,707
She did not poison me.

34
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,379
I poisoned myself.

35
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,724
I did it because I hated that
I was incapable of casting spells.

36
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,349
My maid only risked her life
by doing what she was told to do.

37
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,430
It was all my doing.

38
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,033
-Jang Uk, how could you?
-Please save it for another time.

39
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,911
He still has not recovered
from the poison.

40
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,490
Punish him all you want,
but wait until he has fully recovered.

41
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,367
Uk almost died just now.

42
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,714
Please do not scold him like that.

43
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,460
Look at how pale he is.

44
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,920
Take him home for now.

45
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,133
Young Master, let us go.

46
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,014
Go to Sejukwon and receive treatment.

47
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,631
Mu-deok needs to go too.

48
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,798
Now is not the time.

49
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,806
Mu-deok needs to get treatment too.

50
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,468
Otherwise, I will not go.

51
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,766
Young Master.

52
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,939
Fine. Go ahead and die!

53
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,898
-Lock them back up!
-Calm down, Uncle.

54
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,070
If Uk is right,
that maid did nothing wrong.

55
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,029
She is severely injured.

56
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,283
Without treatment, she could die.

57
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,611
I am surprised she is still alive
even after all those beatings.

58
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,908
If she dies, I will allow you
to hold a funeral for her.

59
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,798
Please help.

60
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,428
Mu-deok risked her life
to do what I asked.

61
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,096
We need to treat her at Sejukwon
to save her life.

62
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,154
Please help her.

63
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,658
I want them out of my sight.

64
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,622
Take them both to Sejukwon.

65
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,543
Uk.

66
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,210
Young Master, go on ahead.
I will take Mu-deok there.

67
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,721
Mu-deok.

68
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,378
Mu-deok, wake up.

69
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,530
-I will take her.
-No.

70
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,411
I will do it myself.

71
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,953
You cannot even walk properly.

72
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,708
I can do it. She is my maid,
so I will take her.

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,420
But you are not well either.

74
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,170
You cannot take her there.

75
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,168
Do you think so? Then…

76
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,840
-You carry her on your back.
-Pardon?

77
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,216
Carry her on your back.

78
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,814
-You want me to carry her?
-Yes.

79
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,098
Why should I carry her?

80
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,682
-Come here.
-Young Master.

81
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,354
No, but wait. My goodness.

82
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,057
Oh, my goodness.

83
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,396
Hey, Yul. All right.

84
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,073
Help me instead of Mu-deok.

85
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,735
I do not have the strength to walk.
Take me to Sejukwon.

86
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,991
Do you want me to carry him?

87
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,294
-No.
-All right. Thank you.

88
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,122
Maidservant Kim, be careful!

89
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,747
-Be careful with her!
-All right.

90
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,714
-Goodness.
-What…

91
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,800
Be careful.

92
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,629
Oh, dear.

93
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,630
Uk has opened

94
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,643
his gate of energy in the end.

95
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,927
Right.

96
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,846
He was even willing to end his life.
I could not just sit back and watch.

97
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,436
I guess he knew that

98
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,074
we would never just let him kill himself.

99
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,525
He probably poisoned himself

100
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,284
knowing he would get saved.

101
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,618
Are you all right?

102
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,794
Opening Uk's gate of energy
and treating him

103
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,627
has probably cost me
ten years' worth of energy.

104
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,802
So you not only opened his gate of energy,
but you even gave him extra energy?

105
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,425
What good would it be for an old man
to keep his energy saved up?

106
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,139
He was poisoned,

107
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,854
so I gave him some energy
to speed up his recovery.

108
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,855
Once Uk recovers,
you must retrieve it no matter what.

109
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,145
Is that really necessary
now that his gate of energy is open?

110
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,406
He is at least 20 years behind
when it comes to knowing spells.

111
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,910
Even if he begins training himself now,

112
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,749
he will at least have to be 60
to do anything impressive.

113
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,670
That is the fate he was given.

114
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,053
We must make sure of it.

115
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:29,086
If that is what you wish,
then I will retrieve it.

116
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,295
You know what?

117
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,887
I am too exhausted. I need a break.

118
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,849
Bring me some wine.

119
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,935
Wine?

120
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,105
I mean…

121
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,492
Why would there be wine
in the room of a practitioner?

122
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,820
I saw it.

123
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,122
I saw it hidden in your room.

124
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,540
Come on. The wine you drink
whenever you get lonely.

125
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,540
-I am not lonely!
-My gosh.

126
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,825
I am merely…

127
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,128
Gosh, I have a headache.

128
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,053
It is because of…

129
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,709
What was it called again?

130
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,298
Right. Insomnia.

131
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,715
I have very bad insomnia.

132
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,681
I merely take it for that.

133
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,475
Loneliness prevents you
from falling asleep.

134
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,856
You should have gotten married
when you were young.

135
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:34,572
Are you still not over Do-hwa?
Is that why you are alone?

136
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,415
It is empty.

137
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,456
-What?
-You finished it.

138
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,261
That is not possible. What?

139
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,506
What in the world…

140
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,228
I guess you were unbelievably lonely.

141
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,349
I only had a glass
every time I could not sleep.

142
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,559
I only had one glass each time…

143
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,781
This is the wine that
my uncle hides in his room.

144
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,486
It tastes quite nice.

145
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,713
Anyway, Uk's life-long dream
has finally come true.

146
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,038
So let us celebrate.

147
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,210
That girl, Mu-deok…

148
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,342
He recently brought her
from a brothel, right?

149
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,339
She risked her life for him
even though they only just met.

150
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,643
It is strange.

151
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,559
Uk saved her
from having to become a gisaeng.

152
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,929
She hated it so much that
she even pretended to be blind.

153
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,687
Have a drink.

154
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,979
"Blind"?

155
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,106
Yes. According to Ju-wol,
she was blind when she came

156
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,071
but could see just fine when she left.

157
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,071
The wine tastes great.

158
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,366
She easily deceives people.

159
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,617
She lied about being blind
and even said she poisoned Uk.

160
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,253
She did not speak
even though she was tortured.

161
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,460
There is more to her than meets the eye.

162
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,091
On the outside,
she just looks cute and naive.

163
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,419
She seems to be hiding something.

164
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,808
-You finished it.
-What? What about it?

165
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,562
Your uncle is on his way here,

166
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,143
so I am guessing you are doomed.

167
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,769
-I did not drink any.
-Wait. Yul.

168
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,936
Yul!

169
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,073
-Oh, gosh.
-Dang-gu.

170
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,485
I am dead.

171
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,539
Dang-gu.

172
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,615
It was you, right?

173
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,250
No.

174
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,915
Come here.

175
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,552
-Dang-gu.
-Yes, Uncle?

176
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,563
Is she breathing?

177
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,727
You are awake.

178
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,896
You kept passing out,
so I thought you might die.

179
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,664
Gosh.

180
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,077
Does it hurt a lot?

181
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,251
I think I broke my bones.

182
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,082
They said you were fine.

183
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,706
-Really?
-Yes.

184
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,633
Then why does it hurt so much?

185
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,224
What a useless body.

186
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,222
Hey.

187
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,184
Why did you say you poisoned me?

188
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,637
If you pretended like
you did not know anything,

189
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,476
they would not have tortured you.

190
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,401
I had to make them believe
that you were dying.

191
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,530
Otherwise, they would not have
opened your gate of energy.

192
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,034
They just would have made an antidote.

193
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,622
So you really did risk your life.

194
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,499
I thought I might lose
at least an arm or a leg.

195
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,959
But I am surprisingly fine.

196
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,461
The people of Songrim are too nice.

197
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,343
If this is how they torture people…

198
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,420
By the way,

199
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,718
you still seem pretty sick yourself.

200
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,550
Why are you here?

201
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,095
Obviously to take care of you.

202
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,185
All the practitioners here are mages.

203
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,849
They cannot find out about you.

204
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:38,028
So I closed the door
when no one was looking,

205
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,608
changed your clothes for you,
applied ointment on your wounds,

206
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,195
and gave you a massage
whenever you passed out.

207
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,739
-You did?
-Yes.

208
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,964
I am the only person who is safe enough
to come this close to you.

209
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,334
All my life,

210
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,081
no one ever seemed to know
how desperate I was.

211
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,917
No one has ever risked their lives for me

212
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,415
like you did.

213
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,936
Since I survived as promised,

214
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,190
I will serve you as my master.

215
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,742
Up until now, I have served 12 masters.

216
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,750
People think I got kicked out every time,
but I was the one who left.

217
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,882
But now, I have
finally found my true master.

218
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,879
So I shall kneel before you

219
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,211
and swear to serve you
as my master forever.

220
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,721
On one condition.

221
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,008
Do not tell anyone about our relationship.

222
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,975
You will continue to be my owner,

223
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,228
and I will continue to be your maid.

224
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,895
Also,

225
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,741
our relationship as master and pupil
will only last until you become the best

226
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,201
and help me get my energy back.

227
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,544
Only until then.

228
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,997
The moment I get my energy back
and become Naksu again,

229
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,540
we will no longer be master and pupil.

230
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,417
Can you tell me why?

231
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,092
Because then,

232
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,465
you should no longer
have a reason to protect me,

233
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,345
nor should I have a reason…

234
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,055
to go easy on you.

235
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,702
So you want to part ways
once our business is done?

236
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,407
I see.

237
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,409
All right.

238
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,879
Once I am no longer of use to you,
you may abandon me.

239
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,589
Then I will respect your decision
and let you leave.

240
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,553
Now, kneel before your master.

241
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,099
I, Jang Uk, your pupil,

242
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,693
will serve and protect my master, Mu-deok,
with all my heart.

243
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,515
You have returned to your true self.

244
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,405
You will not run wild for a while.

245
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,290
Then I shall meet you in the royal palace.

246
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,052
Feeding human souls
to soul shifters who run wild

247
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,132
allow them to continue to be of use.

248
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,222
Did you kill the gisaeng
that Naksu's soul has shifted into?

249
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,765
Yes, we threw the body away
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

250
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,850
Did you check for the blue mark?

251
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,782
There is no blue mark.

252
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,572
She is not Naksu.

253
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,700
Yes, I checked.

254
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,242
The Naksu I used to know
would not have lost to you,

255
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,621
but she must have lost her energy
due to the body she is in.

256
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,455
Do soul shifters sometimes lose energy?

257
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,876
If a soul is too strong,

258
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:36,432
it enters an unbefitting body
and cannot access its energy.

259
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,258
Have you seen that before?

260
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,439
Your Majesty.

261
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,270
I am Master Jang's pupil, Jin Mu.

262
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,185
I heard you asked for me.

263
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,576
Jin Mu.

264
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,584
Yes, Your Majesty.

265
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,792
I am not the king.
I am your master, Jang Gang.

266
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,289
Right now, my soul has shifted
into the king's body.

267
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,017
Master, is that you?

268
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,558
Yes, the king and I have switched bodies.

269
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,016
Then where is His Majesty?

270
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,904
His soul is inside my body.

271
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,572
I must get my body back.

272
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,651
But I cannot seem to retrieve my energy.

273
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,487
I need you to help me.

274
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,280
Master.

275
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,746
I do not know
how the alchemy of souls works.

276
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,580
Go to the Cheonbugwan Secret Room
and bring me the Soul Ejector.

277
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,205
I shall teach you the alchemy of souls.

278
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,014
He could not retrieve his energy
due to the weak body he was in,

279
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,104
which was why I was given a chance.

280
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,055
I was lucky.

281
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,476
Burn these bodies.

282
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,129
Search the brothel that
the dead gisaeng used to work at.

283
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,131
Find the owner of the Spirit Plaque,

284
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,724
and do it discreetly.

285
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,381
Yes, sir.

286
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,479
What are you doing?

287
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,569
It is cold.

288
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,239
It is freezing.

289
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,083
Of course, it is cold.
So why are you sitting there?

290
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,078
I have never felt this cold before.

291
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,918
I would easily collapse
because my gate of energy was closed.

292
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,211
Even though I am shivering, I can stand.

293
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,955
I guess my gate of energy
is really open now.

294
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,468
If you master your spells,
you will neither feel cold on ice

295
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,010
nor hot walking on fire.

296
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,969
What were you like
before you shifted souls?

297
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,465
I had heard many rumors
since you were so infamous.

298
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,556
But I never actually saw you myself.

299
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,942
I heard you were pretty strong.

300
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:40,734
I was not just strong.
I was extremely strong.

301
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,031
"Extremely"? I see.

302
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,661
In order to become the best mage,
you must go through several steps.

303
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,332
First is Jipsu, the ability
to gather the energy of water.

304
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,167
Second is Ryusu, the ability
to gain energy from the flow of water.

305
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,715
Then comes Chisu,
the ability to control the energy

306
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,223
in the atmosphere.

307
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,388
I am a mage
who has mastered all three steps.

308
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,143
Not many in Daeho have mastered all three.

309
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,936
I guess you really did
live up to your name.

310
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,728
Yes.

311
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,784
I moved silently like a shadow,

312
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,445
and the heads of my enemies
fell to the ground where I passed.

313
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,696
I was Naksu,

314
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,541
the Shadow Assassin.

315
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,433
I walked on water like I was flying,

316
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,715
and the wind blew as I passed by.

317
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,871
If I did this, it would rain.

318
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,455
I am Naksu, the best mage in this land,

319
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,041
who even has the ability
to create snow and rain…

320
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,430
Are you all right?

321
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,054
All I did was run for a bit,

322
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,928
but it feels like
my lungs are going to explode.

323
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,732
What is the matter?

324
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,903
I have cramps!

325
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:44,942
You have cramps?

326
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,235
These legs are short, skinny, weak,
and cannot stand the cold.

327
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,859
What a useless body.

328
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,748
Be careful. You are no longer Naksu,
the Shadow Assassin.

329
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,868
You are Mu-deok, our family maid.

330
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,075
You should not run around
like you did earlier.

331
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,751
You could get hurt.

332
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,668
I feel miserable.

333
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,764
Do not feel miserable. You have me.

334
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,814
Let us begin training
now that my gate of energy is open.

335
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,139
But first, put your shoes back on.
It is cold.

336
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,661
What was that for?

337
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,532
You are not agile.

338
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,751
Pick it up.

339
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,285
What are you doing?

340
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,712
Let me see how good my pupil is
so I can forget how miserable I feel.

341
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,956
What?

342
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,652
Why did you hit me?

343
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,728
You have no swordsmanship.

344
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,321
Then show me how you fight.

345
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,665
You little…

346
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,290
Gosh, that hurts.

347
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,345
You fight poorly too.

348
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,558
You are worse than what I had expected.

349
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,484
That is because I never learned properly!

350
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,611
You had 12 masters.

351
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,697
You may not have been able
to learn how to cast spells,

352
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,161
but you could have learned
basic martial arts.

353
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,413
I did not feel motivated to do so.

354
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,495
As you already know,

355
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,830
I need to feel motivated
in order to do something.

356
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,826
Because you are lazy.

357
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,085
I have noticed that
you never do anything around the house.

358
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,302
I know everything by heart. Test me.

359
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,012
How do you think I recognized you?

360
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,602
It was because I saw you using Tansu.
I know it all.

361
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,345
You are all talk.

362
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,930
I can do more than talk now.

363
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,638
Did you just see that?

364
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,358
I am a quick learner.

365
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,318
I will quickly master Jipsu.
How long does it take?

366
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,529
I was a fast learner,
but I took five years.

367
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,400
Those who are slow take 20 years.

368
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,607
As for you…

369
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,116
You may master it pretty quickly

370
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,164
since you are Jang Gang's son.

371
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,123
What does he have to do with this?

372
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,075
He was a genius
who only took a year to master Jipsu.

373
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,092
If you achieve that,

374
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,748
rumors that say
you are not his son will subside.

375
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,957
But of course,
I doubt it will be possible.

376
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,625
If he took a year,
I will do it in six months.

377
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,587
No, I will do it in three months.

378
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,008
You are bluffing.

379
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,016
I am determined, so do not discourage me.

380
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,186
Maidservant Kim asked me
to sweep the entire yard.

381
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,188
You have recovered a lot,

382
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,193
and you seem to be doing better,
so help me out.

383
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,034
What…

384
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,124
Mu-deok.

385
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,580
I am a lazy guy who does not do things
he does not feel motivated to do.

386
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,576
Good luck.

387
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,924
That little…

388
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,091
-That…
-It is cold. How chilly.

389
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,510
That lazy, useless show-off!

390
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,799
It is so chilly. It is way too cold.

391
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:49,059
Master Heo has made
herbal medicine for Uk.

392
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,192
It seems to be extremely effective

393
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:55,071
now that Young Master's
gate of energy is open.

394
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,412
Maidservant Kim, you seem very delighted.

395
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,288
Are you really that upset
that his gate of energy is open?

396
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,250
You did not do anything
even when he was about to die.

397
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:15,132
If not for Master Heo,
Young Master Jang would have died.

398
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:19,051
He should have looked for a way
to save him without opening his gate.

399
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,382
How cold of you.

400
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,046
You have always kept a distance
from Young Master Jang.

401
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,137
Is it…

402
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,472
because of the rumors?

403
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,398
What rumors?

404
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,732
Of course, you would know.

405
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,525
You know that there are
rumors going around

406
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,911
saying you are the father
of Young Master Jang.

407
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,945
Do not dare to speak of

408
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,785
such absurd rumors!

409
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,496
It is not completely absurd.

410
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,713
Let us be honest. We both know that

411
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,625
you used to fancy Madam Do-hwa
before she got married.

412
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,925
You used to write her poems
and give her gifts.

413
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,180
I am a living witness.

414
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,219
People say you are still single
because you are not yet over her.

415
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,559
What about you, Maidservant Kim?

416
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,937
Are you still head over heels
for Jang Gang?

417
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:19,232
Is that why you are unmarried
and still living in his house?

418
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,689
What?

419
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,737
I know very well
how much you used to like him.

420
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,124
When he told you that
he liked acorn jelly,

421
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,951
you climbed mountains to collect acorns

422
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,956
-like some kind of a squirrel.
-A squirrel?

423
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,418
I saw you going around collecting acorns.

424
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,545
What is your point?

425
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,838
Are you making fun of the fact that
I went around collecting acorns?

426
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,296
Fine!

427
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,430
I admit I went here and there
to collect acorns.

428
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,846
Making acorn jelly was the only way
I could express my feelings for him.

429
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,069
You can mock me all you want.

430
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,486
I am not mocking you.

431
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,620
Seeing you make all that acorn jelly…

432
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,828
made me feel sad.

433
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,085
I know how it feels

434
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,801
to be in a situation
where you cannot do anything

435
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,798
for the person you love.

436
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,296
Other people can say

437
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,560
what they want to say about us
behind our backs,

438
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,643
but let us not do the same to each other.

439
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,569
It is obvious to us both
that the passionate love we had

440
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,397
back when we were young

441
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,908
only ended up
leaving a scar in our hearts.

442
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,290
I got too worked up
about Young Master Jang

443
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,246
and said things I should not have said.

444
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,625
Forgive me.

445
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,917
I also care for Uk greatly.

446
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,677
I am just afraid that
opening his gate of energy

447
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,308
might have broken the barrier
that is protecting him.

448
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,480
It just makes me feel anxious.

449
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,980
I may have to break his will

450
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,444
and stop him in the future.

451
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,283
Please do not resent me for that.

452
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,989
Let us see how things go.

453
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,585
Young Master, this is wild ginseng tea.

454
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,460
Drink up.

455
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,666
"Wild ginseng"?

456
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,008
I will drink it after I return. Leave it.

457
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,262
Are you trying

458
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,433
to give it to Mu-deok again?

459
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,642
It is cold outside.
She deserves something nice and warm.

460
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,024
Why did you make her
sweep the yard out in the cold?

461
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,403
Wait.

462
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,613
That maid is getting treated for free.

463
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,611
So I asked her to do her part.

464
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,493
Why does it have to be her?
Could you not do it instead?

465
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,525
I need to heat up your medicine,
prepare your meals,

466
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,736
and take care of you.

467
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,286
Mu-deok will take care of me.
You do not need to worry.

468
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,706
Oh, I see.

469
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,001
So you only care about Mu-deok.

470
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,093
Since I am now considered useless,

471
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,931
I will go outside
and sweep the yard just like Mu-deok.

472
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:38,391
It is just that I feel like
I am putting you through a lot.

473
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,564
How long did it take for you
to boil this wild ginseng?

474
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,524
I boiled it for the entire day.

475
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,154
That is my point.
You did not get to sleep a wink.

476
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,902
How do you think that makes me feel?

477
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,951
-Not good.
-Right?

478
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,450
I know I put you through a lot
with all the trouble I caused.

479
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:00,906
Look at how tired you look.
You used to have porcelain skin.

480
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,711
You should be the one
drinking this wild ginseng tea.

481
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,051
So will you stop causing so much trouble?

482
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,958
I do not know what to say to the leader.

483
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,967
If he punishes me, so be it.

484
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,889
My gates are open now,
which means I will be a part of Songrim.

485
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,098
Are you that happy
that your gates of energy are open?

486
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,346
Yes, I am.

487
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,153
Once I enter Songrim
and become better than Yul and Dang-gu,

488
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,651
they will regret
not having taken me in sooner.

489
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,534
Maidservant Kim, you can have the ginseng.

490
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,622
Thank you for the ginseng.
I appreciate it.

491
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,831
-Sure.
-Thanks.

492
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,721
You must be the spiteful maid.

493
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,763
What are you doing? We gave you treatment.

494
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,006
Your wounds could get infected.

495
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,808
I got treated for free,

496
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,442
so I was told to work to show gratitude.

497
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,560
Maidservant Kim is a wise woman.

498
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,154
Sweep the yard nice and clean.
Then manure the medicinal herb garden.

499
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,026
All right.

500
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,570
You just wait, Heo Yeom.

501
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,025
Right now, I may be
sweeping your front yard.

502
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,986
But one day, I will get rid of Sejukwon.

503
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,536
Hey! Watch it.

504
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,253
Was that on purpose?

505
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,745
No.

506
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,705
I think it was on purpose.

507
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,955
That is absurd.

508
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,798
You are an odd one.

509
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,854
This ear…

510
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,809
I have seen this ear before.

511
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,809
Have I ever treated you before?

512
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,478
How would I be able to afford
getting treated at Sejukwon?

513
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,490
This ear looks familiar somehow.

514
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,407
Sweep the yard properly.

515
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,924
He almost ripped my ear out.

516
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,302
I know it hurts, but bear with it.

517
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,719
He is angry with Young Master Jang
and is taking it out on you.

518
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,929
It is normal to pick on the weak.
That is how the world works.

519
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,062
I will just stay quiet.

520
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,179
If that is the case,
try not to resent him.

521
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,136
He gave ten years' worth
of his torrent of energy

522
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,186
to help your young master heal faster.

523
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,807
Get some rest once you are done.

524
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,743
Ten years' worth of his torrent of energy?

525
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,003
What took you so long?

526
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,213
Come here. This is wild ginseng--

527
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,208
What is it, Mu-deok?

528
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,006
What are you doing?

529
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,052
Stay still.

530
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,926
This is not what I had in mind
when I brought you here.

531
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,261
Mu-deok, this is wrong.
I am your pupil. Stop it.

532
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,851
My gosh.

533
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,397
What are you doing right now?

534
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,822
I am checking the core of your energy.

535
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,032
Breathe properly.

536
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,212
It is there.

537
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,255
It really is inside.

538
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,009
You really are special.

539
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,888
Cut it out.

540
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,393
What is inside my stomach?

541
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,933
A great torrent of energy.

542
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,890
Heo Yeom placed a torrent of energy
in your stomach.

543
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,234
A torrent of energy?

544
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,162
Uk seems to have recovered now.

545
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,872
It is time you retrieve
the torrent of energy you gave him.

546
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,043
If it surges the wrong way,
it could make him go mad.

547
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,578
Uk will not be able to use it.

548
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,630
His gate of energy just opened.

549
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,133
There is nothing he can actually do.

550
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,585
You are worried for nothing.

551
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,719
He probably does not even know
that there is something great inside him.

552
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,773
Let us steal Heo Yeom's torrent of energy.

553
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,324
The core of your energy is filled
with the energy that Heo Yeom gave you.

554
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,355
You are now strong enough
to use Jipsu with ease.

555
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,204
I had no idea that
something so precious was inside me.

556
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,580
It takes ten years to gather
this kind of torrent. You got it for free.

557
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,868
And it is Heo Yeom's,
the best you could ask for.

558
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,115
You are one lucky punk.

559
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:56,464
I thought that old man hated me.
I am surprised he gave me this.

560
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,552
He probably gave it to you
to help you recover.

561
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,878
He will take it back soon.

562
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,343
He cannot do that.
It is in my stomach, so it is mine.

563
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,505
If you do not have
the power to control it,

564
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,474
it cannot become yours.
He can take it back whenever.

565
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,175
To keep this, I need to be able
to control energy,

566
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,266
which means I need to breathe
just like the source of the energy.

567
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,112
I guess those 12 masters
taught you a thing or two.

568
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,281
Correct.

569
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,568
The energy from your core
is controlled by your breathing.

570
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,874
However, every mage breathes differently.

571
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:31,618
There is a difference in how much air
one breathes in and out.

572
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,495
It is Heo Yeom's energy,
so we must control it with his breathing.

573
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,376
I doubt he will teach me.

574
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,590
Should we just try everything?
After all, it is just breathing.

575
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,719
If you use someone else's breathing,
you could lose control and go mad.

576
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:51,638
You will shed blood
from every hole in your body and die.

577
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,022
Should we still try?

578
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,055
No.

579
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,270
You are way too extreme.

580
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,316
Think of a way to keep me alive
along with this energy, Master.

581
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,987
The most basic breathing skill
is handed down to you by your family.

582
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,992
Heo Yeom is a member of the Seo family.

583
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,204
So anyone from that family
will use the same breathing technique.

584
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,709
-Seo Yul.
-Seo Yul.

585
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,508
Go ask him. You said you were close.

586
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,142
Yul is a careful guy.

587
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,009
If I ask,
he will catch on and tell Heo Yeom.

588
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,176
Just ten breaths…

589
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,978
No, seven will be enough.

590
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,902
I will be able to know
by putting a hand on his core of energy.

591
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,861
He will break your hand
before his first breath.

592
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,277
You have a point. He is not like you.

593
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,704
Me?

594
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,992
What is wrong with me?

595
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,458
What? What is with
that condescending look?

596
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,880
Anyway, I do not think
I can do to him what I did to you.

597
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,420
No, wait. Mu-deok.

598
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,053
Look at me in the eyes.

599
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,470
So you feel uneasy about touching him
unlike how you felt with me?

600
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,140
You are so immature.
How is that even important?

601
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,800
"Immature"?

602
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,684
Yes, it is important.

603
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,675
Are you insane? What are you doing?

604
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,597
I am sane.

605
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,015
-No, let us say I am insane.
-Let go of me.

606
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,769
What are you doing?

607
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,363
Hey.

608
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,372
Why do you keep badgering Mu-deok?

609
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,031
She is still sick.

610
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,157
I was not badgering her.

611
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,214
-Seriously?
-Goodness.

612
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,869
I thought you were being nice.

613
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,789
Mu-deok, are you all right?

614
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,260
Your young master expects
a lot from you, does he not?

615
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,550
You not only need to care for him,
but you must keep him amused too.

616
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,845
He asks for warm water,
but when I bring it,

617
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,349
he asks for cold water again…

618
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,310
-Hey, that--
-He says something is salty,

619
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,060
but later on, he complains it is bland.

620
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,442
-Me?
-He is immature and fickle.

621
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,900
He is lazy but full of himself.

622
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,073
But what can I do?

623
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,439
He is my young master,

624
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,486
so I have no choice but to serve him.

625
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,493
Mu-deok, you seem to know
a lot about him already.

626
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,912
I am embarrassed for you.

627
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:20,115
Anyway, what are you two doing here?
Why are you not at Sejukwon?

628
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,504
We were looking at Yul.

629
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,795
Mu-deok asked me to come.

630
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,224
Yul?

631
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,934
Why not go see him up close?

632
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,141
We were doing it in secret.

633
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,351
Mu-deok seemed to feel uneasy
about approaching him,

634
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,563
so I stayed with her.

635
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,149
Mu-deok, you must have feelings for Yul.

636
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,243
-No--
-Dang-gu.

637
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,198
You caught on very quickly.

638
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,109
This is making me blush.

639
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,617
-Young Master! This is a misunderstanding.
-Do not be shy.

640
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,621
Many women have fallen for Yul.

641
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,374
-It is natural you feel that way.
-It is not…

642
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,575
I will help Mu-deok.

643
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,246
Uk, go to the reception room.

644
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,544
Why?

645
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,168
Master Heo wants to see you.

646
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,264
Master Heo?

647
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,913
Goodness.

648
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,118
I heard you asked for me.

649
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,245
Yes.

650
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,372
The sound of your cough is nice and clear.

651
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,208
I guess you are feeling much better.

652
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,673
I still feel dizzy and nauseous.

653
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,878
I also keep fainting.

654
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,006
But I am getting better thanks to you.

655
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,182
I saw you and your maid

656
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:03,101
energetically walking around this morning.

657
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,682
How strange is that?

658
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,813
Hey, come stand here.

659
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,307
I need to take something from you.

660
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,146
Before you do,

661
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,779
I brought something for you.

662
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,573
For me?

663
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,989
Back when I was a child,

664
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,325
I let loose a bunch of goats
in your medicinal herb garden,

665
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,160
and I know you have hated me since.

666
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,915
Those goats ate all the medicinal herbs

667
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,919
and are still living to this day.

668
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,301
Even so, you still saved my life

669
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,299
and kept me alive.
I am extremely grateful for that.

670
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,552
I thought you were a complete lout,

671
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,724
but I guess you have learned
how to express your gratitude.

672
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,854
I have prepared something for you.

673
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,471
Maidservant Kim.

674
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:11,253
This wine was made with spring water
from a volcanic island in Southern Daeho.

675
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,553
It is dark wine,
the best wine you can find in Daeho.

676
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,340
Young Master Jang said
he wanted to thank you,

677
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,894
so I went through great lengths
to acquire it.

678
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,178
This is a rare delicacy.

679
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,403
But do I only get one bottle?

680
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,289
You are a man who knows
how to express your gratitude!

681
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,875
Maidservant Kim, you raised him well.

682
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,422
-You really did.
-Thank you.

683
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,424
Bring it here. Come on.

684
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,553
My goodness gracious.

685
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,271
Three bottles?

686
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,767
Mother.

687
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,731
Uk's gate of energy has opened.

688
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,947
We could not do anything until now
because of the Gwanju's orders,

689
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,662
but does this mean we can
accept him into the family now?

690
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,333
That boy called off the engagement
after he used you.

691
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,667
Yet you still like him?

692
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,629
I was the one
who used him to my advantage.

693
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,587
His gate of energy was closed,
so I used it against him

694
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,381
to try and make him live with us.

695
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,045
Do not distort the truth.

696
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,513
He offered to come live with us
if we helped him open his gate.

697
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,925
That is how he seduced you.

698
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,055
It ended up happening anyway.

699
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,273
If you had opened
his gate of energy back then,

700
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,435
you would have gotten a son-in-law,

701
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:02,654
and I would have married
the man I wanted to marry.

702
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,108
Cho-yeon.

703
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,490
The son of the Jang family
whose gate of energy is now open

704
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,746
will never become my son-in-law.

705
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,871
You will have to take your sister's place

706
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,707
and become the leader
that guards Jinyowon for the family.

707
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,720
Find a man who will support your cause.

708
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,144
If my sister had not died,

709
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,098
I would have gotten married
to the man I loved.

710
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,904
I apologize, Mother.

711
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,191
Go and see if Gwigu's pottery
is back in one piece again.

712
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,697
All right.

713
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,789
Uk even broke this precious Gwigu.

714
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,798
What if I ask him to marry me in return?

715
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,166
I bet he will refuse.

716
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,886
So Yul sleeps in the room
that is at the very far end?

717
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,185
Yes. He enjoys peace and quiet.

718
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,397
What time does he go to bed?

719
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,359
If he is not busy,

720
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,652
he normally sleeps early
and wakes up early too.

721
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,070
Why do you ask?

722
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,026
So you can visit him during his sleep?

723
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,499
No matter how much you like him,
that is wrong.

724
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,789
Here is a tip.

725
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,794
He always eats at the same hour,
so go see him in the dining hall.

726
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,253
All right.

727
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,628
I need to do more than just see him.
I need to touch him.

728
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,855
Mu-deok, are you all right?

729
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,066
Hey, Yul.

730
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,752
Outsiders are not allowed
to read the books in Jeongjingak.

731
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,919
She is only here to help.

732
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,879
Besides, they are all about magic spells.

733
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,840
She would not understand anyway.

734
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,974
You are quite nimble.

735
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,879
Do you know martial arts?

736
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,637
I learned how to dance at the brothel.

737
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,440
That is why I am nimble.

738
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,904
Where is Dong-i?
I need to ask for something.

739
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,368
Well, Dong-i is not here but Mu-deok is.

740
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,372
Mu-deok, come and help him out.

741
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,753
I will help you.

742
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,829
No, that is not necessary.

743
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,219
Shall I clean up, Young Master?

744
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,941
Young Master, are you going to eat?
What would you like to eat?

745
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,188
Young Master! I will…

746
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,338
This is where the Jeongjingak mages live.
Do not follow me any longer.

747
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,137
I heard he sleeps early.
I wonder if he is going to bed already.

748
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,114
Is this the bathhouse?

749
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,742
I told you to leave.
Why do you keep following me?

750
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:09,875
I still figured there might be
something I could do.

751
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:11,749
Is there

752
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,801
something you want from me?

753
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,506
I need to touch it. Now is the chance.

754
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,140
What made you follow me
all the way to the men's bathhouse?

755
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,345
This is my chance. Six breaths
and I will know how he breathes.

756
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,184
One.

757
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,140
Two.

758
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,192
Three.

759
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,029
Four.

760
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,247
What was that for?

761
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,004
I was so close to figuring it out.

762
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,166
I know you also stared at me
from afar with Uk.

763
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,715
Why did you follow me?

764
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,551
I just need him to take one more breath.

765
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,465
Give me an answer.

766
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,721
I am in love with you!

767
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,634
Are you all right?

768
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,999
It hurts.

769
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,813
You must be after my breathing technique.
You keep reaching for my core of energy.

770
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,404
But I am in love with you.

771
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,943
You are such an adept liar.

772
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,819
I bet that move earlier
was martial arts too.

773
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,025
I lived a harsh life,

774
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,525
so I learned a few moves
just to keep myself safe.

775
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,197
Are you doing this for Uk?

776
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:54,416
I guess he is trying to control
the torrent of energy inside him.

777
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,419
But Uk will not succeed
even with my breathing technique.

778
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,129
Stop wasting your time.
Just get treated and leave.

779
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,989
So you remember me,

780
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,119
Yul.

781
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:57,118
I did not ignore you because I hated you.

782
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,745
Your mother, Do-hwa,
was like a daughter to me.

783
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,674
I am pretty much your grandfather.

784
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,344
You little lout.

785
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,639
Right, Grandfather.

786
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:19,018
Your mother, Do-hwa,
was extremely kind-hearted.

787
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,060
Was she?

788
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,230
Yes, she was! You need to know that.

789
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:29,447
Always remember that
and ignore what everyone else says.

790
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,199
That poor kid…

791
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:41,167
The length and depth of how much air
he inhales and exhales.

792
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,353
That is hard to play. I am impressed.

793
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,768
I know how to do many things.

794
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,685
I would like it back.

795
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,190
It looks very old.

796
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,737
Why do you have something so old?

797
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,235
It belongs to an old friend.

798
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,214
Seeing that you have it
instead of your friend,

799
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,050
I am guessing that friend is gone.

800
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,554
Yes.

801
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,886
It belonged to that friend.

802
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,727
It means a lot to me, so give it back.

803
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:47,321
Then in return for giving it back,
teach me your breathing technique.

804
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,401
You said it was
going to be useless anyway.

805
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,697
To me, this is just as useless.

806
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,620
So let us trade.

807
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,868
This means nothing to me,

808
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,370
so I could even break it.

809
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,266
Only three breaths.

810
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,484
Where is she?

811
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,170
What is that look on your face?

812
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,045
That is no ordinary look.

813
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,755
I like him.

814
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,056
You set it up that way.

815
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:52,315
I followed Yul around saying I liked him
and finally found out.

816
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,608
I see.

817
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,452
You are a sensitive person
who kills everyone who gets near,

818
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,778
but you decided to fancy a guy
just so you could help your pupil.

819
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,034
What about you?

820
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,787
I hope you did not let Heo Yeom
retrieve his torrent of energy.

821
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,210
It is safe inside me.
I found out his breathing technique too.

822
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,749
So you wasted your time.

823
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,382
You found out? Do not lie to me.

824
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,302
I bet you are bluffing

825
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,549
just to act like
you did something important.

826
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,681
I breathed the way he did,

827
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,048
and I think I feel something
moving inside me.

828
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,937
The energy is surging inside you.

829
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,685
It worked.

830
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,152
Were you this close with Yul?

831
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,859
Be careful. I can still see
the mark in your eyes.

832
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,866
I kept using the eye drops.

833
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,497
I didn't see the mark in the mirror.
Do you still see it?

834
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,119
I can see if I look this close.

835
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,166
If you really like him,
this is how close you will get.

836
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,040
So be careful who you fall for.

837
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,085
Only I get to come this close.

838
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:02,337
Fine. I will only allow it to you.

839
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,143
I will try not to fall for Yul.

840
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,889
What?

841
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,055
Why does that require effort?

842
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,269
He is handsome.

843
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:16,194
It takes effort
not to fall for a handsome man.

844
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,484
What about me?

845
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,737
I guess you have been trying hard
not to fall for me as well.

846
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,950
Not at all.

847
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,817
Why not? It makes no sense.

848
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,447
-Just tell me it has been hard.
-Yes, Young Master.

849
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,285
-Say it like you mean it.
-Yes.

850
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,210
-Will you keep this up?
-Yes.

851
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,709
Come on. Humor me.

852
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,722
Your Royal Highness.

853
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,887
Judging by the energy on your sword,

854
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,733
you have reached the highest stage
of the second step, Ryusu.

855
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,307
It is all thanks to your guidance,

856
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,898
Assistant Gwanju.

857
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,653
The only person
who is on a similar level as you

858
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,985
is probably Seo Yul from the Seo family.

859
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:31,492
Her Majesty the Queen and Yul's father,
General Seo, are siblings.

860
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,696
Yul and I were close as kids,

861
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,706
but things changed
after he joined Songrim.

862
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,964
Seo Yul, Park Dang-gu, Jang Uk,
and Jin Cho-yeon are known

863
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,804
to some people as Four Seasons.

864
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,421
Let them have their fun.

865
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,053
But wait.

866
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,854
Why is Jang Uk part of the group
when he cannot cast spells?

867
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,394
He can now.

868
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,518
His gate of energy has opened.

869
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,979
His gate of energy has opened?

870
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,272
But there is not much he can do.

871
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,777
He is the son of Jang Gang,
Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.

872
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,358
Recently,

873
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,156
he came and asked me for Naksu's sword.

874
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,156
And?

875
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:19,214
Are you afraid I will do it?

876
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,580
So did you give it to him?

877
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,126
His Majesty ordered you
to keep it inside Cheonbugwan.

878
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,630
The Gwanju position belongs
to a member of the Jang family,

879
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,548
so I had no choice.

880
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,505
How rude of him.

881
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,465
He was probably looking down on me.

882
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,556
After all, I was his father's pupil.

883
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:41,022
If you think about it,
I was not even an official pupil.

884
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,151
I had nowhere to go
after I got kicked out by the Jin family,

885
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,067
and he took me in as his servant.

886
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,201
You are the teacher
of this country's crown prince.

887
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,030
How dare he look down on you.

888
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,985
That is the same thing as insulting me.

889
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,196
I just want to apologize that

890
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,292
your teacher is someone
who comes from a low status.

891
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,295
One of these days,

892
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:10,512
I must crush that Jang Uk.

893
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,703
That sword belongs to Gwanju Jang,
Jang Uk's father.

894
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,279
I once…

895
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,748
promised to take him in
if he successfully unsheathed

896
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,116
his father's sword.

897
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,786
Now that his gate of energy is open,
it will be possible.

898
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,546
Are you going to let Uk
become a mage of Songrim?

899
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,625
Go bring Uk.

900
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:06,227
What did you say?
The father of this child is whom?

901
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,443
The late king.

902
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,687
He is the king's son!

903
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,660
Are you saying he is the son

904
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,204
of His Majesty who died last year?

905
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,115
The late king

906
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,617
passed due to a severe illness
and could not even move.

907
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,877
So how is that possible?

908
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,538
The day this child was born,

909
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,132
a star that symbolizes the king
was found in the night sky.

910
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,627
The late king's brother
had already taken over the throne,

911
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,473
and he even has a son to succeed him.

912
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,684
If the royal family finds out that
this child was destined to be king,

913
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,388
they will see it

914
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:46,809
as treason.

915
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,402
His existence will bring chaos.

916
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,034
He should not attract attention
or challenge anyone.

917
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,544
We must make people think
that he is nothing special.

918
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,002
I sincerely apologize

919
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:13,259
for all the trouble and chaos
I have caused.

920
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,891
Songrim decided

921
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:20,302
to open your gate of energy,

922
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:22,683
so you will not be held responsible.

923
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,185
I, Jang Uk, the eldest of the Jang family,

924
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,058
am now ready to practice and learn.

925
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,266
If Songrim gives me a chance,
I will do my very best.

926
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,645
And to show my loyalty,

927
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:37,565
I will pass on Naksu's sword,
a sword I took from Jin Mu,

928
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,155
and keep it in Songrim's Sword Room.

929
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,290
I refuse the offer.

930
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:52,456
That sword was meant for the Jang family,
so your family can keep it safe.

931
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,428
You may take your father's sword as well.

932
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:07,979
From this moment forward,
I hereby banish Jang Uk from Songrim.

933
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,614
I allowed you to freely enter

934
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,742
as you were the son of an old friend.

935
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:24,700
But you have no right
to enter Songrim as a mage.

936
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,748
From now on,

937
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,630
Jang Uk will not be given access
to anything in Songrim.

938
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:38,880
Hand in the Spirit Plaque
that allows you to enter this place.

939
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,221
I do not have it.

940
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:46,845
What?

941
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,139
I lost it.

942
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,015
I lost the Spirit Plaque.

943
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:56,606
What kind of punishment is given

944
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,278
to those who lose the Spirit Plaque?

945
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,529
A hundred floggings, my lord.

946
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,195
Then I hereby order
a hundred floggings for Jang Uk

947
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,334
for having lost the Spirit Plaque.

948
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:46,334
He has Master Heo's torrent of energy,
so he will be all right.

949
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,749
If you get involved,
it will only make it worse for him.

950
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,380
Jang Uk, leave Songrim

951
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,458
and do not ever come back again.

952
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,380
Leave.

953
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:47,675
No.

954
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:48,801
No.

955
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,848
I cannot leave like this.

956
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,596
I was only flogged 99 times.

957
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,982
There is one more left.

958
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:02,034
As for the last one,

959
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,114
you should do it yourself.

960
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,049
I am merely trying to keep him safe.

961
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:28,391
If his gate of energy remains closed
and he lives as my son, he will live.

962
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,599
However, if he chooses
to discover his fate instead,

963
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:35,927
he will not survive.

964
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,699
Uk, just stand down, give up,

965
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,957
and live a quiet life.

966
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,673
That is the only way you can live.

967
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,200
Mu-deok.

968
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,870
Get the sword.

969
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:11,776
Let us go.

970
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:10,091
I want to unsheathe it and show them.

971
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,972
-Is that an act of stupidity?
-No, It is an act of vigor.

972
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,049
Stay strong.

973
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,263
There is another sword here that
you cannot unsheathe.

974
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,104
But that belongs to his father.

975
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,430
I must take it with me.

976
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,426
Whoever wins shall take the sword.

977
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,558
Going against you would be
an act of stupidity.

978
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:29,066
However, there is someone who sees it
as one of vigor. So I shall try.

979
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,818
My pupil is still too weak
to fight against you.

980
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,489
You have put him in danger once again.

981
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,660
And he will get what he wants once more.

982
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:45,754
