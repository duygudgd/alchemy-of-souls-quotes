1
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,137
Yul from the Seo family.

2
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,441
Do not come back here ever again.

3
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,237
If we meet again,

4
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,283
I will kill you.

5
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,584
Wait--

6
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,444
I could not stop her from leaving.

7
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,688
I could not ask her why.

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,195
The moment she sliced
my sincerity in half,

9
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,286
I could no longer cherish
our memories together.

10
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,208
It became a secret
that I had to bury within my heart.

11
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,966
You are up early. Why are you out here?

12
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,562
Why…

13
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,016
did you come here?

14
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,098
I caught a bird. I will cook it for you.

15
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,482
I do not enjoy eating.

16
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,527
I will be cooking rice with chestnuts.

17
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,913
The chestnuts here are very sweet.

18
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,584
Danhyanggok has very sweet chestnuts.

19
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,218
I do not enjoy sweet things.

20
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,765
You could have just declined.

21
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,229
Given your power,
you could have killed me just now.

22
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,190
Do not overreact.

23
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,478
While it is true I pushed you away,
it was with no intention to kill.

24
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,148
So you did push me away.

25
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,698
Do not bother to prepare breakfast.

26
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,240
I will leave once Dang-gu wakes up.

27
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,874
Be my guest if you do not wish to eat.

28
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,889
Why are you still here?

29
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,013
I will eat before I go.

30
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,678
Prepare some food for me.

31
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,386
I thought you did not wish to eat.

32
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,266
I never said that.
Do not put words in my mouth.

33
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:56,321
Since you were drunk yesterday,
I thought you would still be hungover.

34
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,952
I only declined
because I did not want to burden you.

35
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,241
I understand.

36
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,203
In that case,

37
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,874
-I should rinse some more rice.
-Where is it?

38
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,247
-I will do it.
-Have you cooked rice before?

39
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,632
I have not, but I can do it
as long as you teach me.

40
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,173
It is quite simple.

41
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,298
Rinse it in water,
then pour in a decent amount of water,

42
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,844
and cook it on high heat.

43
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,848
Then let it sit for some time.

44
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,891
It is pretty simple.

45
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,068
You said you could do it if I taught you.

46
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,862
You said it was simple.

47
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,486
I was wrong. I am sorry.

48
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,703
Jeez. Look at this.

49
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,367
It is all burnt.

50
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,254
Let me make it up to you.

51
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,375
How about those vegetables?

52
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,881
Teach me how to chop them.

53
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,468
-Jeez, what a waste of rice.
-Goodness.

54
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,692
Dang-gu.

55
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,693
Hey.

56
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,943
You should bathe here before you go.

57
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,895
The mineral water makes your skin soft.

58
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,565
Have some breakfast too.

59
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,993
Right.

60
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,201
Mu-deok and Yul
are making breakfast together.

61
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,486
-Together?
-Yes.

62
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,866
Yul is cooking rice with Mu-deok.

63
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,417
Goodness.

64
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,929
I told you to cut
the green onions into big pieces.

65
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,022
-This big?
-No.

66
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,234
Do you not understand
what "big pieces" mean?

67
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,902
Big pieces.

68
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,026
Big pieces…

69
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,399
You are wrong.

70
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,196
Those are too small.

71
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,907
Like this.

72
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,914
Big pieces. Like this.

73
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,039
You should have elaborated more.

74
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,043
How was I to know
when all you said was "big pieces"?

75
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,456
I thought you were
the best mage of Jeongjingak.

76
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,005
How could you not differentiate
what is big from small?

77
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,127
Forget it.

78
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,638
Pour a bowl of water into that soup.

79
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,438
Wait…

80
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,190
Which bowl are you talking about?

81
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,244
This one?

82
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,820
Or do you mean

83
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,453
this one?

84
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,502
That one.

85
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,588
Why does it look like
Mu-deok is scolding him?

86
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,840
Are you sure she likes him?

87
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,383
That is the type of girl she is.

88
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,603
She does not easily like
or feel shy in front of others.

89
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,060
Goodness. Look at Yul.

90
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,563
He is still learning well
despite being scolded.

91
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,068
-Learning?
-Look.

92
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,567
I said that was enough.

93
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,407
I do not enjoy salty food.

94
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,076
Jeez.

95
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,405
He was never like that

96
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,415
-Taste it yourself.
-in front of Master Heo or my uncle.

97
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,708
This is interesting.

98
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,212
Does he not look like
an intimidated pupil?

99
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,665
It is bland, right?

100
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,514
See? You should have stopped
when I told you to.

101
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,012
-I am sorry.
-A cute master and her diligent pupil.

102
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,428
That is enough. It needs to boil down.

103
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,635
-A master and her pupil?
-Let it sit.

104
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,016
Why were you so stubborn

105
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,233
when this was your first time cooking?

106
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,364
All right.

107
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,077
Let me see how well you taught him
and how well you learned from her.

108
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,158
Let me have a taste.

109
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,831
It is tasty.

110
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,208
Tasty?

111
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,840
I seasoned it just as Mu-deok told me to.

112
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,005
Well done.

113
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,885
You must have been elated
to be complimented by your master.

114
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,774
I thought I was good at everything
since people called me a genius.

115
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,731
But I learned that there are things
I am not good at.

116
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,773
Mu-deok.

117
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,476
Thank you for helping me realize this.

118
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,736
It was frustrating
since he could not understand me at all.

119
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,490
But he was determined to keep learning.

120
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,827
That is why I kept teaching him.

121
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,749
Look at you exaggerating.

122
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,671
Is this a royal meal or something?

123
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,538
There are things you can learn
from preparing a meal.

124
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,206
-You should learn as well.
-Sadly,

125
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,014
I do not have a great master like he does.

126
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,934
I am sorry, but the rice is a bit burnt.

127
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,679
-I see.
-You can learn how to do it again.

128
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,222
Mu-deok, do you think
Yul can do better next time around?

129
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,847
He is not completely hopeless.

130
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,595
Thank you for your words.

131
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,997
Why are you washing them alone?

132
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,208
Ask your wonderful pupil to help you.

133
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,999
He prepared the meal,
so I ought to clean up.

134
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,917
Were you happy to teach him?

135
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,798
Do you want him

136
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,554
to be your pupil?

137
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,632
It would have been easier
had he been my pupil.

138
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,298
He is diligent and obedient.

139
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,266
He is not lazy or reckless like you.

140
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,848
Master, do not cheat on me.

141
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,266
What?

142
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,653
I get that you like him
since he is diligent and obedient.

143
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,071
But I am your one and only pupil.

144
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,610
A master should not have
multiple pupils and vice versa.

145
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,905
Are you upset
because I taught Yul how to cook?

146
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,910
Yes, I am. How could you
teach someone else

147
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,042
when your pupil is standing
right in front of you?

148
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,790
If you are going to teach someone
how to cook, it should be me.

149
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,502
Teaching someone else
is betrayal and cheating.

150
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,285
I can try to understand the betrayal part.

151
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,587
But cheating?

152
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,130
I am speechless.

153
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,295
I am certain

154
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,220
that I sensed cheating.

155
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,771
What was that?

156
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,733
What is it this time?

157
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,574
Mu-deok, do not cheat on me.

158
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,070
It hurts and upsets me.

159
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,951
I did not know
my pupil was this possessive.

160
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,525
Fine. My one and only pupil

161
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,695
will be you who spews nonsense
first thing in the morning. Happy?

162
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,405
-But--
-Mu-deok!

163
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,414
Mu-deok!

164
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,920
Young Master.

165
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,337
Would I be cheating
if I addressed others as Young Masters

166
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,302
and answered their calls?

167
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,131
That cannot be helped.

168
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,716
But when you address them,

169
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,222
be a bit indifferent.

170
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,354
How ridiculous.

171
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,356
Young Master Park! I am coming!

172
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,478
Mu-deok, you are hurting my feelings.
I told you to be indifferent.

173
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,908
That is one tall tree.

174
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,372
Yul, was this the tree you wanted to see?

175
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,957
I think so.

176
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,417
I cannot believe it really exists.

177
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,522
How did you know that I was injured?

178
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,024
There is a really tall tree nearby.

179
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,150
I can see the entirety
of Danhyanggok from up there.

180
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,532
You can see the entirety
of Danhyanggok from up there.

181
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,997
Does that mean you have climbed up

182
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,424
that tree before, Mu-deok?

183
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,379
That was just my guess
since the tree was so tall.

184
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,427
Then do you want to climb it?

185
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,179
Should I help you get up there?

186
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,465
Dang-gu, you cannot climb that tree.

187
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,886
You need to have mastered
at least Chisu to go up there.

188
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,154
Is that so?

189
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,270
Should I try?

190
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,856
Yes.

191
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,860
Maybe you could do it.

192
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,743
Mu-deok, go with him.

193
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,528
Do you want to go up there?

194
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,119
No, thank you.

195
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,326
I do not want to climb
such a special tree with just anyone.

196
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,085
"Just anyone"?

197
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,469
I guess she is too afraid to go up there.

198
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,894
Let us go.

199
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,275
I examined the core of his energy.

200
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,319
He was a commoner, not a mage.

201
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,494
I am certain that there are more victims.

202
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,957
There is a soul shifter among us.

203
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,460
What should we do, Master Lee?

204
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,382
Locating the origin of
this sorcery is direr

205
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,961
than catching the soul shifter.

206
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,337
I suspect Cheonbugwan.

207
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,175
This soul shifter
who had entered Songrim recently

208
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,056
was a constellation recorder mage there.

209
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,805
Also, the one who killed Naksu,
who died while soul shifting,

210
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,773
and destroyed all traces of her men

211
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,483
was Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu.

212
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,651
Naksu…

213
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,366
We identified him
with the possessions he had.

214
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,582
Who was he?

215
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,042
He was a low-ranking servant
from Cheonbugwan.

216
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,593
What? Cheonbugwan was involved once again.

217
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,338
I will confront Jin Mu right now.

218
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,011
Follow me.

219
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,299
Yeom!

220
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,926
Yes?

221
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,723
Do not do anything.

222
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,716
You used to ruin everything
due to your recklessness back in the day.

223
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,887
You may have aged now,
but your temper remains.

224
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,480
I am sorry, Master Lee.

225
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,192
It is not the time yet.

226
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,232
We must observe Cheonbugwan discreetly.

227
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,608
Jin.

228
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,162
You have grown up well.

229
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,578
You used to wear a diaper and roam around.

230
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,908
I cannot believe you are all grown up
and leading your people.

231
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,788
Master Lee.

232
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,679
Who is he?

233
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,345
He was the pupil

234
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,307
of Master Seo Gyeong,
the founder of Songrim.

235
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,810
But he is so young.

236
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,266
He is not.

237
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,856
I still remember singing…

238
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,938
at his 100th birthday party.

239
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,074
I even danced.

240
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,707
Is this dog Gwigu?

241
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:03,376
So it was you
who took Gwigu from Jinyowon.

242
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,720
He will find the soul shifter.

243
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,968
Naksu was the one
who died while soul shifting, right?

244
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:10,892
Yes, Master Lee.

245
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,430
She was a notorious assassin
who was talented in spells.

246
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,349
Was it Naksu's soul that I sensed?

247
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,200
The one who has Jang Gang's sword

248
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,454
-is his son, Jang Uk, right?
-Yes.

249
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,367
Have you seen him before?

250
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,327
I met a boy with a binding bracelet

251
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,588
and his maid who followed him around.

252
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,629
It was interesting.

253
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,273
Mu-deok packed us some chestnuts.

254
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,980
Yes, they are sweet.
Give some to Maidservant Kim as well.

255
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:01,941
Sure.

256
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,486
Why did you bring your father's sword?

257
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,365
Oh, that? Mu-deok brought it.

258
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,541
You are not going to train,
so why did you bring this precious sword?

259
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,658
Should I give it to Maidservant Kim?

260
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,463
You…

261
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,791
are not

262
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,297
his son.

263
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,930
Do as you wish.

264
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,309
-Let us go.
-Sure.

265
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,648
Did you say
you came here often to pick herbs?

266
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,860
Have you ever encountered someone
who lived here?

267
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,952
No, Young Master Seo.
Who would live in a place like this?

268
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,572
I see.

269
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,496
One more thing.

270
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,669
Did it get pretty cold during the winter?

271
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,536
Why do you ask?

272
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,421
I never came here during the winter.

273
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,426
I worried whenever it started snowing.

274
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,022
I worried if it was too cold

275
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,850
or if things were all right amid the snow.

276
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,864
It is actually warmer

277
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,949
than you think.

278
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,037
The snow quickly melts in the sunny spots.

279
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,920
Is that so? I am relieved.

280
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,471
There is a variety of food
to eat during the winter

281
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,099
and many places
to take refuge from the snow.

282
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,347
-I bet this will be tasty.
-They are really sweet.

283
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,725
Should we stay a day more?

284
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,652
Mu-deok must really like him.

285
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,950
She does not

286
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,408
like him.

287
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,996
I am telling you. She does.

288
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,628
Look.

289
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,799
She does not look at us
the same way she looks at him.

290
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,933
The wind keeps blowing.

291
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,317
Is it coming from her?

292
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,030
Dang-gu, let us go.

293
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,735
All right.

294
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,786
Goodbye, Mu-deok.

295
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,291
Let us go.

296
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,216
I will see them off.

297
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,152
-Bye.
-Bye.

298
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,279
Try to remember
where you had lost your Spirit Plaque.

299
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,953
-I will.
-Lie low.

300
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,619
The Unanimous Assembly
was summoned because of you.

301
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,621
I guess all 12
of my former masters attended it.

302
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,544
They were all so heartless
to their former pupil.

303
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,088
They even mentioned
cutting off your energy flow.

304
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,086
-Why would they say that?
-What?

305
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,341
Because you avoided your duel by fleeing.

306
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,811
But it is a ridiculous duel.

307
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,718
And you did not want it either.

308
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,017
Nobody is expecting you
to come to that duel.

309
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,771
So just stay here
and be laid-back like always.

310
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,858
The leader wanted to know something.

311
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,492
He asked if you were doing
as you were told.

312
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,739
You are

313
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,291
the result of your mother's love affair.

314
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,909
But we cannot allow you
to lead Cheonbugwan after your father.

315
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,167
So stop dreaming of becoming…

316
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,495
like your father.

317
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,128
Just stay a clueless Young Master

318
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,218
of the Jang family.

319
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,927
Can I tell him that you are?

320
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,937
Have I ever listened to anyone?

321
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,441
Tell him I am doing
the very opposite and being reckless.

322
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,862
Dang-gu, leave that here.

323
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,781
Why?

324
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,954
I want to help Mu-deok catch a pheasant.

325
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,579
Goodbye.

326
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,633
Did we hurt his pride?

327
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,592
Let him be.

328
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,171
We cannot ask him to come
and meet a dignified death.

329
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,480
So you retrieved the sword you threw away.

330
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,020
It hurt my pride to hear
that I was a laughingstock.

331
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,899
In that case, let us train
as if your life depended on it.

332
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,356
You seem happy

333
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,873
to hear that your pupil
became a laughingstock.

334
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,078
Since we are on the topic,
let me add more motivation.

335
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,619
Your friends did not ask you
to return home with them.

336
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,457
Had they been in your shoes,
they would have fought to their deaths.

337
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,463
But they told you to hide and run away.

338
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,667
Can you guess why?

339
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,724
That is because you are worthless.

340
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,599
Your tongue is sharp like a sword.

341
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,475
You do not hesitate to cut me
with your words. How merciless.

342
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,811
I would not hesitate
to stab you with a sword

343
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,897
if that could get you back on your feet.

344
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,032
Yes, Master.

345
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,359
Keep stabbing your worthless pupil.

346
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,122
Why are you not motivated
after what I said?

347
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,489
Why are you dispirited?

348
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,214
Your spiteful words demotivated me.

349
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,416
I need to bathe and cool myself down.

350
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,169
Why does he bathe so much in one day?

351
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,753
You worthless and lazy scumbag.

352
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,168
I hope you burn yourself in hot water!

353
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,009
Unbelievable. What kind of a master
says such a thing to her pupil?

354
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:58,404
Did Uk not know
how he lost his Spirit Plaque?

355
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,484
Maybe someone sold it
after he had dropped it,

356
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,815
and that is how those men got hold of it.

357
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,860
I heard there was a place
where they sold such plaques.

358
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,870
Keep tracking his Spirit Plaque.

359
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,332
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

360
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,659
How…

361
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,077
is Uk doing?

362
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,249
He is doing well. He fishes and drinks.

363
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,457
He has yet to unfasten
the binding bracelet.

364
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,890
You may go.

365
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,616
It is not that heavy anymore.

366
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,239
It does not hinder my movement either.

367
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,906
Some mages train with an iron rod
to strengthen their arms

368
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,035
to better wield their swords.

369
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,709
You were unknowingly
strengthening yourself

370
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,002
by wearing that heavy bracelet all day.

371
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,496
It was not intentional,

372
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,878
but you found yourself
an excellent training tool.

373
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,715
You are extraordinarily lucky.

374
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,181
If I take this off,
I will be faster and stronger.

375
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,234
But if you fail to control yourself,
you will become even more reckless.

376
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,017
I…

377
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,687
Never mind.

378
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,699
What did you and Yul talk about?

379
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,624
About Danhyanggok.

380
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,618
He asked how it was during the winter.

381
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,672
You have met Naksu

382
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,089
when you were young?

383
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,088
I was still unsure after seeing her body.

384
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,716
But going to Danhyanggok
helped me confirm it.

385
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,894
That is why I am telling you now.

386
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,773
Danhyanggok is
a deep and dangerous valley.

387
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,521
A young girl cannot possibly
survive there on her own.

388
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,324
It seemed like she was living in hiding.

389
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,113
After she learned
of my name and my family,

390
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,781
I was not able to see her again.

391
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,450
That must mean she recognized your name.

392
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,333
Tell me everything you know about her.

393
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,504
There is nothing.

394
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,876
I do not know her name or age.

395
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,415
Other than the cliff
where we called out for birds,

396
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,165
I have never been to her abode.

397
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,263
There is one thing.

398
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,101
She once mentioned her father.

399
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,913
My father wrote down the stars.

400
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,235
I did not think much of it back then.

401
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,958
But writing down the stars
is what a constellation recorder

402
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,619
from Cheonbugwan does.

403
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,130
My lord.

404
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,666
Among their constellation recorder mages,

405
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,665
do any of them have a grudge against us?

406
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,966
A constellation recorder

407
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,644
from Cheonbugwan?

408
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,730
A mage?

409
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:32,233
Twenty years ago, there was
one constellation recorder mage who died

410
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,569
in the hands of the four families.

411
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,737
His entire family
lost their lives that day.

412
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,829
Except for one member.

413
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,711
His one and only daughter disappeared.

414
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,977
So our family was involved

415
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,863
in her father's death.

416
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,155
She must have been hostile toward you

417
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,569
because your family was involved
in her father's death.

418
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,578
Is there anything else that you remember?

419
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,831
This was a very long time ago.

420
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,582
I do not remember anything else.

421
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,274
Because I missed them.

422
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,777
The broken leg did not bother me.

423
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,651
And I was not scared to get scolded.

424
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,905
I liked them a lot.

425
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,258
I saw you using that
to summon your bird a few times.

426
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,426
I would also like to try.

427
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,348
Can I have that?

428
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,856
The Crown Prince is powerful.

429
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,908
There is only one way
my pupil can subdue him and stay alive.

430
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,197
Tansu.

431
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,987
What do you want me to do?

432
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,619
Slice through the water drops
as they fall.

433
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,325
They are not raindrops.

434
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,792
Even someone unskilled as you

435
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,333
can slice through
such slow-moving water drops.

436
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,881
Go on.

437
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,069
Only three drops in one breath.

438
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,112
That does not matter.

439
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,743
Tansu, the skill you will master,
will only require you to slice one.

440
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,952
Tansu?

441
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,661
Look here.

442
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,660
I understand that I am a quick study,

443
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,077
but mastering Tansu is pushing it.

444
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,745
I guess having 12 masters
in the past has taught you something.

445
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,844
That is correct.

446
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,709
You can only learn that skill
once you have mastered Chisu.

447
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,340
You barely mastered Ryusu,

448
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,054
yet you are still struggling
to control your energy.

449
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,965
A subpar pupil like you cannot learn it.

450
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,425
But?

451
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,387
But that is the only way

452
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,360
for you to fight against the Crown Prince
and come out alive.

453
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,938
Tansu is swordsmanship that involves
flicking energy with your sword.

454
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,808
Your right arm may lack the skills,

455
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,111
but it has become stronger
thanks to the binding bracelet.

456
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,113
Just one drop.

457
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,203
Hit one waterdrop
so you can gather and flick your energy.

458
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,292
You will not master it that quickly.

459
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,421
Let us eat and resume.

460
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,764
Tansu?

461
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,354
He will never master that skill.

462
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,899
That is not a relationship
of a maid and her young master

463
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,654
but that of a master and her pupil.

464
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,083
Mu-deok.

465
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,337
So you are training him.

466
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,260
I see he was studying Tansu.

467
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,343
Where did you learn that?

468
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,926
Young Master Jang is quite knowledgeable
thanks to his former 12 masters.

469
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,064
Is he trying to run
before learning to walk?

470
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,271
He has a long way to go.

471
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,601
In any case, he should try.

472
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,898
His next step could lead him to his death.

473
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,113
Is your young master aware of that?

474
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,482
Why did you not dodge it?

475
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,647
Seriously.

476
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,751
That is the result
of forcing your energy to come out.

477
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,971
Your arm could burst if this continues.

478
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,467
It looks like it could rot.
Then you will have to cut it off.

479
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,271
Are you serious?

480
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,528
If the rotten energy spreads
throughout your body,

481
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,400
you could die.

482
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,380
The heat has subsided. You are fine.

483
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,085
Rest up. That is the best remedy.

484
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,894
What a liar.

485
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,854
Everything he said was true, right?

486
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,230
But then again, whether I die of poison,

487
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,099
flogging, being stabbed,
or my hand exploding,

488
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,192
this merciless master does not
worry about her pupil.

489
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,185
That is right.

490
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:46,121
It is because you are
extremely lucky and worthy.

491
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,196
Lying is becoming second nature to you.

492
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,461
I am just not trying to dispirit you.

493
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,211
I see. Thank you, my cruel master.

494
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,884
But stay away
when I am holding a sword from now on.

495
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,553
You almost got stabbed back there.

496
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:06,011
I only stood still
because I wanted you to control it.

497
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,925
I was not trying to hinder you.

498
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,772
You were not hindering me.
I am just worried about you.

499
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,436
Think of me as a mother bird
who is worried

500
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,573
about her egg cracking.
Can you even relate?

501
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,200
Whatever. What you did
barely made me crack.

502
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,398
I could have dodged it.

503
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,365
It was not dangerous?

504
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,658
How could you have dodged it
when I was so fast?

505
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,412
You were not that fast.

506
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,448
You little…

507
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,869
Could not dodge that, could you?

508
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,457
You attacked without warning!

509
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,292
Really? Then I will warn you.

510
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,458
Mu-deok, your eyes.

511
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,303
Jeez…

512
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,130
You bastard.

513
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,216
I cannot believe you fell for that again.

514
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,431
Do that again.

515
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,935
From this up close?

516
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,598
-Really?
-Try me.

517
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,436
Mu-deok.

518
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,863
The blue marks are barely visible now.

519
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,068
They were quite pretty.

520
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,542
And you should not provoke me
when we are this close.

521
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,496
Do you not think I would do

522
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,002
something else from this distance?

523
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,255
I guess you understood what I meant.

524
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,263
Maybe there are things
I can teach you in this field.

525
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,892
Jang Uk.

526
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,864
You must think I am naive
for having lived alone here.

527
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,574
Well, I guess.

528
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,527
I will have you know
I can teach you in other ways too.

529
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,869
Such as?

530
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,288
Hey! You…

531
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,544
A truly skilled individual attacks

532
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,746
when their enemy least expects it.

533
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,127
Keep that in mind, my pupil.

534
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,801
Unlike me, you poked me really hard!

535
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,507
Mu-deok.

536
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,522
Hey. Mu-deok.

537
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,526
Is that a new concubine?

538
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,453
He does not even bother
to follow the formalities anymore.

539
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,325
She is from a small family of mages
from the east.

540
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,661
A comet brushed past the Big Dipper
the day she was born.

541
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,458
At this rate, he will summon every woman
born with strange horoscopes.

542
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,173
He just wants the King's Star.

543
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,102
When the late king ascended the throne,

544
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:04,404
it was prophesized that the next king
would have the energy of the King's Star.

545
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,283
The people of Daeho were delighted.

546
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,239
However,

547
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,448
your father who had an ordinary horoscope
ascended the throne next.

548
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,320
And you are no different either.

549
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,655
So people started talking.

550
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,365
The divination was incorrect.

551
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:23,173
Gwanju Jang Gang fled
after giving such a ridiculous divination.

552
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,289
Your father believes in it.

553
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,626
That is why you are afraid.

554
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,549
I am not afraid.

555
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,432
You are afraid that someone
with that energy will appear

556
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,680
or that your father
may have a son like that.

557
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,385
I am aware of that.

558
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,560
Your duel against Jang Uk
is around the corner.

559
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,976
Eliminate the son of that man
who gave such a terrifying divination.

560
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,399
You must get rid of your fears
when you can.

561
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,201
Do you think

562
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,535
he will even show up that day?

563
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,616
I heard he fled.

564
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,998
Rumor has it that he is even
contemplating marriage to avoid it.

565
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,457
Marriage?

566
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,464
I heard he is marrying into the Jin family
so he can earn the Jin family's plaque.

567
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,887
Uk and Cho-yeon are getting married?

568
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,522
Did they not break off
their engagement before?

569
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,395
That is why
it is easier to prepare for it.

570
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,397
She still had the marriage gifts

571
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,652
from last time.

572
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,776
I see.

573
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,161
After the marriage ceremony, Jang Uk…

574
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,202
I mean, my husband will move in here.

575
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,214
But my current room
is too small for both of us.

576
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,750
Can we use
the big room in the east instead?

577
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,087
But that is your sister's room.

578
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,141
It is the best room we have.

579
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,258
It is such a waste
to keep it vacant for over a decade.

580
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,724
It was never vacant.

581
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,143
Bu-yeon will return.

582
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,311
I am sorry, Mother.

583
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,936
Your father is looking for her.

584
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,200
Your sister will return home soon.

585
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,986
Bring me the yin-and-yang jade
from Jinyowon.

586
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,712
The yin-and-yang jade?

587
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,169
You have been wanting that.

588
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,748
They say when you and your lover
wear rings made of that jade,

589
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,546
your love for each other deepens.

590
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,684
Craft your wedding rings with it.

591
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,845
Thank you, Mother.

592
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,750
What an annoying pot.
It was you, was it not?

593
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,788
How annoying.

594
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,006
I guess it annoys you

595
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,181
that I am getting married.

596
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,300
But wait and see.

597
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,966
I will become even more annoying

598
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,814
once I wear a ring made of this jade.

599
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,700
Eat up.

600
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,986
All right.

601
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,866
I had brought home a pheasant earlier.

602
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,912
So why are there only greens?

603
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,406
It is inside--

604
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,001
It is in the soup.

605
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,832
The pheasant was so tiny.

606
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,667
There was not much left
after making that broth.

607
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,677
I do get a very faint taste of it.

608
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,477
I overheard this
while selling herbs in Songrim.

609
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,935
Two prominent families
will be marrying off their kids.

610
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,446
Who will be getting married?

611
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,448
Lady Jin's daughter is getting married.

612
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,197
Cho-yeon is getting married? To whom?

613
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,405
To the son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.

614
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,076
Is that not you?

615
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,220
I was never told I was getting married.
What is going on?

616
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,965
What is up Maidservant Kim's sleeve?

617
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,807
Most hastened weddings
tend to be shotgun weddings.

618
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,943
That is not true.

619
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,100
You were previously engaged to her.

620
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,362
Maybe you could not control yourself.

621
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,650
How could she be pregnant
when we were never this close?

622
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,606
Right. You are all talk.

623
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,856
What?

624
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,818
Then why did you refuse
the chaste herb tea?

625
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,908
That is because…

626
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,998
I have plans to marry later on.

627
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,581
You must want to get married one day.

628
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,416
Yes, I do.

629
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,633
I truly want to.

630
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,920
I will get married at all costs.

631
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,257
Wait up.

632
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,192
Why did you want to see me?

633
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,405
When will the mother-of-pearl cabinet
that I ordered from Songrim come?

634
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,280
It is for Uk and me.

635
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:52,365
The trade from the south
will arrive in two weeks.

636
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,410
That will be too late.

637
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,874
I should have ordered sooner.

638
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,827
Forget about the mother-of-pearl cabinet.

639
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,296
You should inform Uk first.

640
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,959
He has no idea about this.

641
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,679
That is why
I have written a letter to him.

642
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,929
Read it and share your thoughts.

643
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,769
Sure.

644
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,597
It is fragrant.

645
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,977
This is a perfume
that incurs the feeling of love.

646
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,358
A treasure of Jinyowon.

647
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,740
Gosh, it is very fragrant.

648
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,301
Why are you sniffing it?

649
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,346
Stop that!

650
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,392
Hold your nostrils shut!

651
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,566
I almost wasted the precious perfume.

652
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,493
Please give this to him.

653
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,287
And make sure there are no women
around him when he opens it.

654
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:21,923
I will.

655
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,375
What are you doing?

656
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:33,135
Uk's hand size is similar to yours, right?

657
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,348
Why do you ask?

658
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,640
Come with me to get our wedding rings.

659
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,056
Lend me your hand.

660
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,272
Why would I go there with you?

661
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,516
Go with your groom.

662
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:50,696
Marriage should only happen
when both sides agree to it.

663
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,071
I pity you for being like this.

664
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,197
Why?

665
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,746
Do you think I am getting ahead of myself?

666
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,495
Do you think he will break it off again?

667
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,172
Whether you are getting ahead
of yourself or not,

668
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,137
I will help you.

669
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,139
Just make sure it pans out.

670
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,943
And I will lend you my hand.

671
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,701
Come to think of it,

672
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,409
Maidservant Kim was against the
idea of me living with the wife's family

673
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,580
the last time we discussed
marriage with Cho-yeon.

674
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,252
There is only one reason
why this is being discussed again.

675
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,958
She wants to save me.

676
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,791
She must have made
a deal with the Jin family

677
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,207
to avoid your duel with the Crown Prince.

678
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,296
She probably needed Lady Jin's help.

679
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,378
If that were the case,

680
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,847
will you get married?

681
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,597
What should I do, Master?
Should I get married?

682
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,097
Can I?

683
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:10,648
If you do, we can
no longer stay in Danghyanggok.

684
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,154
Right. I should return home.

685
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,446
Even still,
we cannot have this relationship.

686
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,410
Why not? I can still keep you
by my side as my maid.

687
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,289
I have no plans
to stay by your side as just a maid.

688
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,135
You can go ahead alone.

689
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,725
I will be at Chwiseonru.

690
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,151
If you do not pick me up,
I will go back alone.

691
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,620
CHWISEONRU

692
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,086
What is going on?

693
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,840
We are from Cheonbugwan.

694
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,802
We were told to escort you.

695
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,722
Let us go.

696
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,056
This is the Crown Prince's sachet.

697
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:25,808
I have His Royal Highness' protection.
You cannot touch me.

698
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,480
What are you doing? Let me go!

699
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,435
This is the Crown Prince's sachet.

700
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,663
We brought her
from Chwiseonru like he wanted.

701
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,080
Chwiseonru?

702
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,304
The girl you wanted is here,
Your Royal Highness.

703
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,048
Where?

704
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,846
Over here.

705
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,146
Her?

706
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,268
Lift your head up.

707
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,253
Why are you dressed like that?

708
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,343
I do not know.

709
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,087
She did this to me
after I was dragged here.

710
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,218
Did you do that?

711
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,390
Is she not the gisaeng

712
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,511
from Chwiseonru?

713
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,850
No, she is not.

714
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,811
-She is Filthy Mu-deok.
-Filthy?

715
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,146
Get out.

716
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,315
Go.

717
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,704
Look at you.

718
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,908
Why did you want to see me?

719
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:10,833
I had something to tell you,
so I told them to get you.

720
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,924
But you are not Filthy Mu-deok right now.

721
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,629
Filth and silk do not go hand in hand.

722
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,915
Maybe in your dictionary, it does.

723
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,344
Did you just snap at me?

724
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,973
No, Your Royal Highness.

725
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,010
I am grateful that you dressed someone
as filthy as me in silk.

726
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,888
All right. This new look…

727
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,138
does not suit you.

728
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,399
Since you do not like it
and I am uncomfortable in this,

729
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,744
let me go get changed.

730
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,899
No.

731
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,661
It is all right. Just keep it on.

732
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:52,208
Tell me what you want, and I will do it.

733
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,578
Tell your young master

734
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,498
not to show up that day.

735
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,999
I do not want to kill him

736
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,257
and become enemies with Songrim
or the Jang family.

737
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,256
It is best that he fled,
and let us keep it that way.

738
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,263
So he just needs to be the laughingstock.

739
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:10,971
That is right.

740
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,889
If he becomes stubborn, dissuade him.

741
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,898
He will die if he fights me.

742
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,612
Tell him to stay hidden,
then get married to the Jin family.

743
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,993
So it is true
that getting married will save his life.

744
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,043
What will happen to you
if he gets married?

745
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,250
Will you go with him?

746
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,213
No, I will not.

747
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,502
Why not? Did he refuse?

748
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,800
You were even willing
to drink filthy chamber pot water for him.

749
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,552
He knows neither loyalty

750
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,973
nor duty.

751
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,388
He does know a bit, Your Royal Highness.

752
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,894
Are you taking his side?
You were always bad-mouthing him.

753
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,766
I am sorry, Your Royal Highness.

754
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,019
It would please you if I bad-mouthed him.

755
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:04,607
But I have no energy
to run my mouth right now.

756
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,784
You are a filthy mutt
who will be abandoned by its owner.

757
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,166
Should I take you in?

758
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,546
I can do that.

759
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,431
There must be things you can do here too.

760
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,640
No, thank you.

761
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,934
I may be a filthy girl
whom everyone avoids,

762
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,306
but I refuse to serve just anyone.

763
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,444
Forget it. I do not want
someone filthy by my side either.

764
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,107
-You may leave.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

765
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,198
I will go now,

766
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,035
Your Royal Highness.

767
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,957
"Just anyone"?

768
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,588
But I am the Crown Prince.

769
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,675
Filthy Mu-deok does not know

770
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,300
to whom she is speaking.

771
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,529
-Be gentle. Take your time.
-Yes, ma'am.

772
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,489
Maidservant Kim.

773
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,791
How have you been?

774
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,118
Young Master!

775
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,248
My dear Young Master!

776
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,132
-Young Master!
-Were you worried?

777
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,422
Have you been eating well?

778
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,125
Yes, I have. I have been well.

779
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,675
Goodness.

780
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,258
Your skin is radiating.

781
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,473
Oh, please.

782
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,853
Let us go inside.

783
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,346
Was she the one who tried to sell…

784
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,401
Songrim's Spirit Plaque?

785
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,412
It was not me. It was Mu-deok.

786
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,410
Mu-deok tried to sell Uk's Spirit Plaque?

787
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,754
I just introduced her to the seller.

788
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,829
In the end, Ae-hyang snatched it herself.

789
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,875
So Mu-deok and I are innocent.

790
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,891
What is this?

791
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,520
Why are you dressed like that?

792
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,983
It is a long story.

793
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,817
Have you returned to Chwiseonru?

794
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,945
Did Uk send you back
since he is getting married?

795
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,321
No, Young Master Seo.

796
00:58:56,407 --> 00:59:00,327
Even if that was the case,
I would never come back here.

797
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,411
Ju-wol finally caved in and told me

798
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,207
that you tried to sell Uk's Spirit Plaque.

799
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,384
Yes, I did.

800
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,165
Why?

801
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,048
Because I needed money.

802
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,843
I wanted to wear pretty clothes,
have good food,

803
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,428
and have fun at places like this.

804
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:23,024
Was that the case
when you were drunk last time?

805
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,185
That is correct. I stole
Young Master Jang's money and drank.

806
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,816
I am just so puzzled by you.

807
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,030
I cannot understand you.

808
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,752
You do not need to.

809
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,620
Just stay that way.

810
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,339
I am going inside.

811
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,089
Would you like to come with me?

812
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:52,799
That is all right.

813
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,168
Goodbye, then.

814
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:04,477
CHWISEONRU

815
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,814
The Spirit Plaque…

816
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,360
So it was you, Naksu.

817
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,615
Young Master.

818
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,415
Why do you not want to get married?

819
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,802
Do you dislike Young Lady Jin?

820
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,209
It is not that I dislike her.

821
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,127
I am just not interested.

822
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,890
You have feelings
for someone else, do you not?

823
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,473
Who is it?

824
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,557
Do I know her?

825
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,599
No, you do not.

826
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,397
So there is one.

827
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,730
I knew it.

828
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:52,864
Who is she?

829
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,440
Well…

830
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,446
She is like
a single bird egg on top of a tree.

831
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,622
I am the only one she has,
so how could I possibly get married?

832
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,620
Those kinds of girls
are the most dangerous!

833
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,963
Those who have nothing to brag about
but are just clingy!

834
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,539
She is not like that.

835
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,094
Who is she? Tell me this instant.

836
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,458
I will take care of it.

837
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,714
Exactly how?

838
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,256
Once I give her
a silk pouch full of money,

839
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,930
she will crack out of her egg
and fly away.

840
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,429
She cannot fly anywhere.
It is not that easy.

841
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,852
In any case, I cannot get married.

842
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,143
So take care of it for me.

843
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,272
You better take care of it, got that?

844
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,403
Young Master.

845
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,610
What is wrong? Are you hurt?

846
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,945
Let me see.

847
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,025
What happened to your arm?

848
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,497
Did it get out of control again?

849
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,341
Please sell that dress.

850
01:01:56,421 --> 01:02:00,051
-It is made of silk, so make it worth it.
-All right.

851
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,093
Our madam is tending
to a customer at the moment.

852
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,887
Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon is here.

853
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:09,178
She is looking for someone
who can craft her wedding rings.

854
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,097
She is marrying
a young master from Songrim.

855
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,324
Then how about this one?

856
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:24,029
These are the works
of Daeho's best craftsmen?

857
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,695
They are stylish but a bit tacky.

858
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,579
Then may I see the yin-and-yang jade?

859
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,325
Seeing it for myself will help me
give you better recommendations.

860
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,183
They say when you and your lover
wear rings made of that,

861
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,758
your love for each other deepens.

862
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,693
Why did the jade break?

863
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,907
It was fine when I took it with me.

864
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:12,412
I see. That is when it broke.

865
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,496
Mu-deok.

866
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,434
Young Lady Jin.

867
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,299
Why are you suddenly leaving?

868
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:30,466
That is Mu-deok. Is Uk here as well?

869
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,766
No.

870
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,730
-I see.
-Since they are attached at the hip,

871
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,612
he must be somewhere in the fortress.

872
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,478
Attached at the hip?

873
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,275
As his maid, she is serving him.

874
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,821
Watch what you say.

875
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:48,869
Mu-deok is not just
any ordinary maid to him.

876
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:53,504
He came by to pick Mu-deok up
when she was drunk recently.

877
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,963
He adores her so much.

878
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,540
He even carried her on his back.

879
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,130
It is obvious

880
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,921
that he picked her from the get-go
because she won his heart.

881
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,755
Is Mu-deok from here? Was she a gisaeng?

882
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,304
She is one poor girl.

883
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,271
No wonder he cares about her so much.

884
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,663
Hey.

885
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,082
You know who I am, right?

886
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,581
Of course, I do.

887
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,122
You are Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon.

888
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,245
You will have to address me
as "Lady" soon.

889
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:47,132
Because I will marry
your young master soon.

890
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,386
Goodness. Congratulations, my lady.

891
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,680
As your master's wife,
you will serve me too.

892
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,640
There is something you must do.

893
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,606
First, carry this.

894
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:04,278
What is this?

895
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,405
What was that?

896
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,236
A broken stone?

897
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,250
It is a precious object.

898
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,463
If it breaks or cracks,

899
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:24,593
you will have to take responsibility.

900
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,383
Is she saying that
when it is already broken?

901
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,340
Take that and follow me.

902
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,724
My lady.

903
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,311
You are not someone I must serve yet.

904
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,642
I must go
to Young Master Jang now. Goodbye.

905
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,479
Is she looking down on me?

906
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,790
Was that real back there?

907
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,759
It is best that
I do not cross paths with him.

908
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,933
Hey! You!

909
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:15,932
The dangerous man?

910
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,225
Or this mean brat?

911
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,890
My lady.

912
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,057
Give that to me. I will carry it.

913
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,395
Sure.

914
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,025
Make sure you do not break it.

915
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,117
So it is broken.

916
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,913
She is going to put the blame on me.

917
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,817
Is this the Jin family's abode?

918
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,062
Why are you not coming?

919
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,374
Mother.

920
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,675
You cannot leave like this.

921
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:27,354
Say that you will marry her
in front of your late mother's portrait.

922
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,976
That is the only way
to protect your father's position.

923
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,729
Maidservant Kim.

924
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,028
Do you think

925
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,200
I really am my father's son?

926
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,122
Do you know

927
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,081
who my real father is?

928
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,418
What do you mean?

929
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,554
You are Gwanju Jang Gang's son.

930
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,673
Yes. That is what I believed all my life.

931
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,587
I do not want to deny it now.

932
01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,636
So…

933
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,720
I will not sit still.

934
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:06,562
Do not stop me

935
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,015
no matter what I do.

936
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:20,157
Maidservant Kim,
the Jin family sent someone.

937
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,079
From Jinyowon? What is it about?

938
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,619
Something happened there.

939
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:28,584
They want Young Master Jang to hurry over.

940
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,745
You were looking for me?

941
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,121
What is this about?

942
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,418
A precious treasure of ours
has disappeared.

943
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,342
And an individual

944
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,802
has disappeared with it.

945
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,890
So this is Jinyowon.

946
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,440
Hey.

947
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:49,201
So it is you.

948
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,922
It has been a long time.

949
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:26,487
You are saying Mu-deok

950
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,036
-disappeared here?
-Yes.

951
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,039
Your maid, Mu-deok,

952
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:35,166
stole our yin-and-yang jade and ran away.

953
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,664
You have been thinking about me,
Your Royal Highness,

954
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,202
so I came to see you.

955
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:13,905
You were longing for
the one you met at Danhyanggok.

956
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,326
I was longing for you?

957
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,674
I have never done that.

958
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:17,999
Open the door.

959
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,053
Open the door to Jinyowon,
where relics and artifacts reside.

960
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,208
You could be possessed by sorcery
and be unable to return.

961
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:25,047
You are just too scared to touch them.

962
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,800
What was that?

963
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,465
Bring Jang Uk.

964
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:31,643
I must hand you over so I can live.

965
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:32,682
It is what must be done.

966
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,441
So Mu-deok was Naksu.

967
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:41,823
Fight like your life depends on it,
my pupil.

968
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:49,411
