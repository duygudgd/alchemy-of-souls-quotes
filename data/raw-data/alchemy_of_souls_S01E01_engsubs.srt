1
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,798
You poor thing.

2
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,884
Child, eat this.

3
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,135
Child.

4
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,806
Go on.

5
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,728
I will bring you more meat.

6
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,730
Eat slowly.

7
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,313
Mom.

8
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,284
Geon!

9
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,832
I told you to reach out to me
if anything were to happen to him.

10
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,667
How could you let things come to this?

11
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,295
He will be fine
once he absorbs human energy.

12
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,880
He returns back to normal.

13
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,840
Your son has run wild.

14
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,179
I shall retrieve his soul.

15
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,848
No!

16
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,392
You were the one
who turned my son into a soul shifter.

17
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,645
Either get him another body,

18
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,980
or feed him the energy of human souls!

19
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,024
Bring back my son.

20
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,276
Bring back my son!

21
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,029
If word gets out that
I used forbidden sorcery,

22
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,615
we will both be doomed.

23
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,867
No…

24
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,785
Please…

25
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,541
No, please. Geon.

26
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,045
Stay with me for just a bit longer.

27
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,797
My son…

28
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,831
Why do the bodies of soul shifters
turn like rocks when they run wild?

29
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,209
A crack forms when the bodies clash
with the souls they carry,

30
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,338
which causes them to lose energy.

31
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,591
This is already the eighth soul
that has run wild.

32
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,552
I guess I should stop shifting souls.

33
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,971
You should go to the royal palace.

34
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,768
His Majesty has been asking
about the new spell

35
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,519
that you have been trying to master.

36
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,514
I hear…

37
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,392
you have been trying to master
a new kind of spell.

38
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,563
It is nothing grand.
It is just a trick I tried out for fun.

39
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,442
I know I cannot ask to live for longer.

40
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,693
However,

41
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,947
it saddens me that I do not have an heir.

42
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,783
I wish you a quick recovery.

43
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,078
I cannot do anything with this sick body.

44
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,039
But I might have a chance

45
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,794
if I were to live in a body
that is young and healthy.

46
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,715
There is no way for humans
to switch bodies.

47
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,263
But you can.

48
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,518
The alchemy of souls.

49
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,862
That is forbidden sorcery.

50
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,240
If a soul clashes with the body,
it could even turn into an evil spirit.

51
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,908
How could I dare

52
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,536
move the soul of a king
to another person's body?

53
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,038
How about your body?

54
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,210
Not for too long. Just seven days.

55
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,671
Let us switch bodies for just seven days.

56
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,927
I heard you once gave a soul
a dead man's body

57
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,347
and that it lived in that body
for over half a year.

58
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,728
I am a king protected by the skies,
and you are the best mage in this land.

59
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,313
So what is there to worry about?

60
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,901
And after seven days,
you can turn things back.

61
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,157
You have mastered the ability
to do something

62
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,742
that only the best mages can do.

63
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,870
Yet you are just wasting your time

64
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,914
shifting souls into dead bodies.

65
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,961
Jang Gang.

66
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,380
Give this king a different body.

67
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,877
His Majesty and I have switched bodies.

68
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,846
I shall make Do-hwa mine.

69
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,432
If she bears a child,
know that it is mine.

70
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,186
Do-hwa.

71
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,733
Do-hwa.

72
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,694
You are very beautiful.

73
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,375
No, that cannot happen.

74
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,757
That cannot happen.

75
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,634
No!

76
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,034
The energy of the sky
rules the wind, clouds, and rain.

77
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,162
This energy reached the ground

78
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,957
and created a huge form of energy.

79
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,418
A country was built around
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

80
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,462
a lake that embodied that energy.

81
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,174
The name of the country was Daeho,
due to the enormous lake it had.

82
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,512
Humans who had the power
to control this great energy

83
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,264
were called mages.

84
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,352
This story is about the mages of Daeho,
a place that does not exist

85
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,396
in both history books or maps.

86
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,041
20 YEARS LATER

87
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,885
So you are Naksu,

88
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,970
the Shadow Assassin
who has been going around

89
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,014
killing the mages in the city.

90
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,682
They call me Naksu,

91
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,060
for wherever I go,

92
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,311
heads fall to the ground.

93
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,772
A beautiful name, is it not?

94
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,024
Kill her.

95
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,361
Shoot!

96
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,124
Do not let her get away.

97
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,292
-Capture her.
-Yes, my lord!

98
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,890
Let us go that way. Follow me.

99
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,694
Over there!

100
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,162
I will not die like this.

101
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,206
I cannot.

102
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,135
Goodness, you are so impatient.
I am coming.

103
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,486
What do you want?

104
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,741
Oh, my goodness!

105
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,725
TAVERN

106
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,484
She is dead.

107
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,549
She does not have the blue mark.

108
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,930
This blue mark proves that
her soul has left this body.

109
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,808
Does that mean she failed

110
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,352
to enter another body?

111
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:21,094
SONGRIM

112
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,474
One.

113
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,727
Two.

114
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,563
Three.

115
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,460
Yul, come here.

116
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,216
Is she Naksu?

117
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,009
Yes.

118
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,555
This mark shows that
her soul has left the body.

119
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,017
Remember this mark.
When someone tries to switch bodies,

120
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,813
it leaves a blue bruise like this
right on top of their heart.

121
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,817
Does that mean her soul escaped her body?

122
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,404
She seems to have tried,
but I think she failed.

123
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,365
This proves that her soul
has escaped her body,

124
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,286
but we found no signs of her soul
having entered another body.

125
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,798
-It is a whistle.
-A whistle?

126
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,759
I once had a similar one myself
back when I had a pet bird.

127
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,139
Did she have a pet bird?

128
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,224
I think she had it for quite a while.

129
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,810
It looks like it is an important item.

130
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,772
She may have been an assassin
who killed people like it was nothing,

131
00:21:55,856 --> 00:22:00,235
but she was still human.
She must have had a story of her own.

132
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,746
A lot of people have
already seen Naksu's body.

133
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,040
Word will spread
about the alchemy of souls.

134
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,710
Has it been 20 years
since we have seen a soul shifter?

135
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,253
Yes.

136
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,758
The last soul shifter ran wild
and ended up killing many people.

137
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,095
I am worried that might happen again.

138
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,057
Uncle!

139
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,644
Uncle, I heard Naksu was a soul shifter.

140
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,147
Master Heo, did you see her too?

141
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,692
You seem awfully excited to start rumors.

142
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,445
Rumors have already spread.
I came as soon as I heard.

143
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,906
-Where did you hear it?
-At Chwiseonru.

144
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,699
You are a mage of Jeongjingak.

145
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,578
But instead of practicing,
you go to bars and listen to rumors.

146
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:57,626
Songrim Jeongjingak is not only a place
for mages to practice their spells,

147
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,586
but also a place to gather information.

148
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,006
Also, Dang-gu here will

149
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,258
follow in your footsteps

150
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,427
and become the leader
of the Songrim household.

151
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,346
He should know his liquor.

152
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,472
Now, tell me.

153
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,475
Which liquor tastes best at Chwiseonru?

154
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,395
I do not go there as often anymore
now that Uk is not here.

155
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,481
"Uk"? The son of Jang Gang?

156
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:23,944
Is he not learning how to write
at the village school in Yeongchundang?

157
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,113
He got kicked out of there ages ago.

158
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,115
Right now, he is in Gisan.

159
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,910
I sent him to receive training
from Buddhist Monk Ho-yeong.

160
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,082
Uk went to train
at a Buddhist temple this time?

161
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,545
Today, I shall end my training.

162
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,715
You have not even finished your training.

163
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,927
How dare you decide
to end the training without my permission.

164
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,387
You asked me to expand my knowledge,

165
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,306
so I read and memorized
hundreds of spell books.

166
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,142
You asked me to train my mind,

167
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,769
so I patiently sharpened
hundreds of swords.

168
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,773
However, you never taught me
any kind of spell.

169
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,734
The only lesson I learned here is that

170
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:09,322
you have no intentions
of teaching me spells at all.

171
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,367
Now that I have learned a big lesson,

172
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,119
I would like to end it and leave.

173
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,831
The leader of Songrim asked me
to keep you here for three years.

174
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,209
I know you are building a sanctuary
with the money I paid you in advance.

175
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,171
I will not ask for a refund,
so I hope it is successfully built.

176
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,301
Where do you think you are going?
I never said you could leave!

177
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,598
Did it sound like
I was asking for your permission?

178
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,269
You were conceived
through your mother's affair

179
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,021
and were abandoned by your father.

180
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,607
So what would you know
about respecting your master?

181
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,443
I refuse to teach a guy like you.

182
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,654
I may not know much about
respecting a master,

183
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,364
but I do know how to be a creditor.

184
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,033
Say one more word,

185
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,327
and you will not be able
to build that sanctuary.

186
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,747
Because I will be getting a refund.

187
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:04,211
No one in this world will teach you spells
because of your father.

188
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,838
Goodness, thank you for your concern.

189
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,384
I will find my own master.

190
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,263
Someone extremely powerful and skilled.

191
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,199
Mu-deok, are you all right?

192
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,013
Why did I have to enter
a body like this one?

193
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,226
I am sure she was blind.

194
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,150
But why is it that I see?

195
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,527
Is it because I am a different soul?

196
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,116
She did not even have a blue mark
showing I entered her body.

197
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,617
How unusual.

198
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,747
Try to bear with the motion sickness.
We are almost there, Mu-deok.

199
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,250
"Mu-deok."

200
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,837
She is a blind girl from the countryside
who got sold off to the fortress.

201
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,759
Sit down. You will fall.

202
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,188
Thanks for the journey.

203
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,065
I will be off now.

204
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,787
What is wrong with me?

205
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,705
I have no strength.

206
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,875
Is this body not capable of
even climbing this?

207
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,128
My arms feel weak.

208
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,297
Mister!

209
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,508
-Help me!
-What…

210
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,343
-Mister!
-Oh, dear!

211
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,761
Mu-deok, hold on!

212
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,720
Mister!

213
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,473
Turn the boat around! Go back!

214
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,141
-My goodness.
-Oh, dear! Mu-deok!

215
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,309
I will fall.

216
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,435
Mister!

217
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:23,410
Why were you hanging from there
when you cannot even see?

218
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,828
You could have gotten hurt.

219
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,123
This is really bad.

220
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,041
My strength is gone.

221
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,006
Is it motion sickness again?

222
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,885
I am so worried about how weak you are.

223
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,929
Weak.

224
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,390
This body is
unbelievably unhealthy and weak.

225
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,227
I should not switch bodies too soon.
Let us stay as Mu-deok for now.

226
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,147
I am sorry, Mister.

227
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,481
It is fine.

228
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,233
It is all because your body is weak.

229
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,152
Let us fill ourselves up.

230
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,832
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

231
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,667
Today, let us eat good food.

232
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,127
It is chicken. Enjoy.

233
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,964
As an assassin,
I am sensitive to the smell of blood.

234
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,926
Thus, I do not eat animals that shed
the same colored blood as humans.

235
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,678
-I will pass.
-Just eat.

236
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,272
It is my first time eating meat.

237
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,775
It is delicious.

238
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,614
Eat up.

239
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,326
I really did not want to send you there,

240
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,204
but it was the only place
that agreed to take a blind person.

241
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,751
"There"? Where are you talking about?

242
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,673
An old woman took her in
after she lost both her parents.

243
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,926
But she got sick and recently passed away.

244
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,512
The debt she had due to her illness
got passed onto her,

245
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,472
which is why she's here to be sold off.

246
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,515
I will be off now.

247
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,768
You cannot sell
this poor soul to a brothel.

248
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,229
-I wish you well.
-But…

249
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,359
I cannot believe he fed me chicken
just to sell me to this place.

250
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,570
I will rip you to pieces
as soon as I regain my power.

251
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,156
You are way too skinny.

252
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,076
I wonder if you will become prettier
if you become chubbier.

253
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,578
Just give up.
Getting chubby will not make me prettier.

254
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,748
I am useless and not suitable
to work at a brothel.

255
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,208
Sell me off to someplace else.

256
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,418
You talk very eloquently.

257
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,170
I heard you sing well.

258
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,631
I hope you sing as well as you talk.

259
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,262
You should wash first.
And doll yourself up.

260
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,361
You even know how to dance?

261
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,071
Did it look like a dance?

262
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,158
If my moves contained power,
your arm would have fallen right off.

263
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,039
I am older than you,
so you should speak in honorifics.

264
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,458
You better treat
our customers with respect too.

265
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,919
You just wait. I will kill you too.

266
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,008
A lot of powerful people
come to our brothel.

267
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,761
The Four Seasons of Daeho
are also regulars of Chwiseonru.

268
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,055
The four what?

269
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,434
There are four different types
of beautiful people in Daeho Fortress.

270
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,603
And they are called the Four Seasons.

271
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,662
The daughter of the Jin family
who has the vitality of spring.

272
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,414
Jin Cho-yeon.

273
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,807
The heir of the Park family
who has the energy of a hot summer.

274
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,142
Park Dang-gu.

275
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,282
The genius of the Seo family
who is as noble as the sunset in fall.

276
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,117
Seo Yul.

277
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:55,098
Then there is Jang Uk,
the successor of the Jang family

278
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,685
who is as dazzling as the winter snow.

279
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,153
The Jin, Park, Seo, and Jang family.

280
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,240
They are the most well-known
mage families in Daeho.

281
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,325
Their children are known as
the Four Seasons.

282
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,079
Is that what they are called
in the fortress?

283
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,251
There is my summer prince.

284
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,216
If he is the heir of the Park family,

285
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,593
he must be Park Jin's nephew.

286
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,139
Park Jin.

287
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,145
He was there that night too.

288
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,697
Jin.

289
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,782
Seo.

290
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,701
Jang.

291
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,619
Park.

292
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,963
The Four Seasons?

293
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,218
Once I come across all four of you,
it will be the end of it.

294
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,724
May you greet your deaths
as beautifully as your names.

295
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,481
Who are you here to meet today?

296
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,401
My uncle told me
to come and fetch someone.

297
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,154
Fetch someone? Who?

298
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,865
A trainee in Gisan

299
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,868
humiliated his master and got sent away.

300
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,497
I bet this is where he is hiding.

301
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,999
Will you look at that?

302
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,336
He must have craved seafood
because he was stuck in the mountains

303
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,421
for so long.

304
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,381
I guess he is in that room.

305
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,236
Goodness.

306
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,656
Thanks to you, my uncle has to go

307
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,742
all the way to Gisan
to beg for the monk's forgiveness.

308
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:24,580
Meanwhile, you are here
enjoying this damn crab.

309
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,332
No, I have not eaten it.

310
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,750
It is such a hassle to eat.

311
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,670
I am glad you came.
Break the shell with your spell.

312
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,922
Unbelievable.

313
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,968
I do know how to crack the shell
and pick out just the meat.

314
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,720
But maybe I should use that spell on you,
not the crab.

315
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,224
Dang-gu, if that monk had been
kind enough to at least teach me that,

316
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,309
I would not have left that way.

317
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,061
What good is it if you cannot do it?

318
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,063
Your dad blocked you from casting spells.

319
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,731
Then he should have helped me break that.

320
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,318
That is what masters do.
They help their students.

321
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,071
No one in Daeho is brave enough

322
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,323
to go against your dad like that.

323
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,992
But some live fearlessly.

324
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,285
For example,

325
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,163
the Shadow Assassin, Naksu.

326
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,668
Do not be ridiculous.

327
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:14,005
I heard she is so skilled that
even the leader cannot beat her.

328
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,632
She is dead.

329
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,136
Her soul left her body,
so that means she might still be alive.

330
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,930
Who told you that?

331
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,225
Do you think I am here
just so I can eat crab?

332
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,560
This is the fastest place

333
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,812
to hear everything that goes on in Daeho.

334
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,772
Pick out the meat already.

335
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,650
Put those spells to good use
and pick out the crab meat.

336
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,987
Why can you not pick out
the meat yourself, you lazybones?

337
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,993
You look pretty now that you have washed.

338
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,244
Let me put makeup on you.

339
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,956
Ju-wol, I will just do it myself.

340
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,751
But how? You cannot even see.

341
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,962
I have never done this in my life,

342
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,131
so I need to prepare myself.

343
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,676
I would like to be alone for a while.

344
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,889
Sure. Come out when you are ready.

345
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,277
Being blind makes it easier
to fool people.

346
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,072
I need money to run away.

347
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,076
Are these made of real gold?

348
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,120
This is jade.

349
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,041
Mu-deok, try applying this new rouge.

350
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,543
What are you doing?

351
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,422
Ju-wol, what is wrong?

352
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,969
Can you see?

353
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,855
Catch Mu-deok! Catch the thief!

354
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,946
It is too high.

355
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,205
That way!

356
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,439
What are you looking at?

357
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,374
You…

358
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,675
Do not make a sound.

359
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,388
I heard a blind girl
recently joined the place.

360
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,057
But you can see.

361
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,811
They told me your name.

362
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,938
I think it started with a "D"
or something.

363
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,106
No.

364
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,650
Oh, I remember.

365
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,444
Mu-deok.

366
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,531
Yes, I am Mu-deok.

367
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,118
I know what you look like,

368
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,496
so if you do not stay quiet until I leave,

369
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,373
I will come back and behead you.

370
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,336
What is so funny?

371
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,672
You have beautiful eyes.

372
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,510
Cut the nonsense.

373
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,639
Right, sorry.
Only your eyes are beautiful.

374
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,725
You must be crazy.

375
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,525
Mu-deok.

376
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,527
Mu-deok!

377
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,739
Come on. There is not much in there.

378
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,867
Just…

379
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,869
take this instead.

380
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,374
Hey…

381
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,312
-What are you looking at?
-What? Nothing.

382
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,652
Dang-gu.

383
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,115
I heard Naksu,
the Shadow Assassin, uses Tansu.

384
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,117
What do you know about Tansu?

385
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,703
I know enough.
I read about it in my free time.

386
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,121
TANSU

387
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,540
You see, Tansu is

388
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,960
a type of swordsmanship
that only the best mages can learn.

389
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,838
You flick energy with a blade
just like how you flick water.

390
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,382
A single strike is enough to kill someone.

391
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,478
But why do you ask?

392
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,607
I am just wondering if this crab leg
almost could have killed me.

393
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,526
Give it here. Give it to me.
I will pick out the meat--

394
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,198
Listen, Uk.
You are aiming at a vital point.

395
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,034
I could die.

396
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,286
Yes, she aimed at my vital point
in just one go.

397
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,417
But why did she roll off then?

398
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,426
Why is it that this tiny body
keeps craving food?

399
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,762
If I do not eat, I only become weaker.

400
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,639
I have no other choice.

401
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,610
Now is not the time to fight.
I should hold it in.

402
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,992
The mages of Jeongjingak are here.

403
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,750
I heard an assassin
has entered Songrim Jeongjingak.

404
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,919
What fool would break into Jeongjingak?

405
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,213
She aimed for the leader, but got caught.

406
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,756
The assassin is a young lady.

407
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,299
My goodness gracious.

408
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,458
He would have seen my dead body.

409
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,002
He likely did not recognize me.

410
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,756
I am sure he did not recognize
the whistle either.

411
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,852
There are no signs of Naksu
having visited this place.

412
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,355
I think she failed to find a new body.

413
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,192
Even if she succeeded,
she probably is not showing herself

414
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,570
because she is facing a problem.

415
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,448
An assassin with a revealed identity
must be discarded.

416
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,869
We will have to
retrieve her body and sword.

417
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,204
Get rid of all everything
that has to do with her.

418
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,250
What happens if she is still alive?

419
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,212
She will either get killed
for being a soul shifter,

420
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,548
or her soul will clash with her new body,

421
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,258
and she will turn into a rock.

422
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,303
I trained her to become the best assassin.

423
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,430
It is a pity.

424
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,398
How much longer do you need?

425
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,444
It is expensive,
so I need to take a closer look.

426
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,822
I will not ask for too much.
Just pick a price and pay me.

427
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,076
Over here!

428
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,578
-It is her.
-What is going on?

429
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,788
Take her away!

430
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,931
Where am I? Did I get caught?

431
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,684
Then is this Songrim?

432
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,271
Are you awake?

433
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,691
Who are you? Where is this place?

434
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,656
It is the house of Master Jang Gang,
the head of Cheonbugwan.

435
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,410
"Jang Gang"?
So this is the Jang family's house?

436
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:13,293
I wonder why Young Master
brought home such a weak girl.

437
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,879
-"Young Master"?
-That is right.

438
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,758
Young Master Jang Uk paid money
to bring you here from the brothel.

439
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:23,387
I heard you stole
his Jade Plaque at the brothel.

440
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,682
Take this instead.

441
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,935
Hey…

442
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,604
Why would he bring me here?

443
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,607
I was worried when he said
he was going to bring home a girl,

444
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,026
but you put me at ease.

445
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,778
He only helped out of pity.

446
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,865
Here. Get changed.

447
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,158
Mu-deok.

448
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,243
-What is this?
-What do you think?

449
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,120
It is your uniform as a servant.

450
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:52,249
Also, you need to speak to me
using honorifics.

451
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,419
Young Master Jang is weak,

452
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,379
so he gets tired very easily.

453
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,715
Make sure you do things
as soon as you are asked.

454
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,927
And always put on a smile
no matter what he says.

455
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,221
Where is my answer?

456
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,475
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

457
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,479
He wanted to see you as soon as possible,
so get changed and go see him.

458
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,646
Answer me.

459
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,482
Yes…

460
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,484
Miss.

461
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,070
I would rather you call me "ma'am."

462
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,576
"Young Master"?

463
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,454
Why would he bring me home?

464
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,042
You have beautiful eyes.

465
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,503
Did he fall for me?

466
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,380
For this face?

467
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,675
He has very low taste.

468
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,560
Anyway, it might be safer for me

469
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,063
to live here until I fully recover.

470
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:01,568
If he is head over heels for me,
at least he will treat me right.

471
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,321
Then…

472
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:08,200
I guess I will have to continue
living my life as Mu-deok here.

473
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,496
Young Master. It is me, Mu-deok.

474
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,581
Come in.

475
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,552
Young Master.

476
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,679
Thank you so much for saving my life

477
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,181
and bringing me here.

478
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,309
It just took a few men to drag you here.

479
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,730
-I am disappointed.
-I know it was rude of me

480
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,859
to threaten you with a crab leg,
but I hope you will put that behind you.

481
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,444
You sound a lot more polite now.

482
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,572
I will do my best to serve you right.

483
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,782
Fine, you do that.

484
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,243
Mu-deok, go and get me some water.

485
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,161
Yes, Young Master.

486
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,253
Gosh.

487
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,755
I am not thirsty. It is to wash myself.

488
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,592
Oh, I see. I understand, Young Master.

489
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,390
I will just take a bath
instead of washing my face.

490
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,481
Gosh, that is hot.

491
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,525
This is much too hot.

492
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,612
Right, Young Master.

493
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,411
Oh, gosh. It is cold.

494
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,872
The water is freezing.

495
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,043
It is not freezing.

496
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,503
It is. I will catch a cold
if I wash in cold water.

497
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,132
-What is his deal?
-It is so cold.

498
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,383
Did he not fall for me?

499
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,926
What are you doing, Mu-deok?

500
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:54,348
Yes, Young Master.
I will pour in some more hot water.

501
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,021
It is salty.

502
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,898
Too sweet. Too spicy.

503
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,524
It is too long. What is this taste?

504
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,859
I'm not going to eat.

505
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,031
The water smells weird.

506
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,658
It smells?

507
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,951
Bring me a new bucket.

508
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:18,955
Get a different blanket.

509
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,209
I want the blue blanket tonight.

510
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,443
He does not do anything,
but he washes three times a day.

511
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,532
I will kill him.

512
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:57,244
Once I regain my energy,
he'll be the first one I kill.

513
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,209
Young Master, I brought you cold water.

514
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,337
-I brought…
-Forget it. The water has cooled

515
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,880
to just the right temperature.

516
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,425
Good work…

517
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,885
I mean, your work was all in vain,
Mu-deok.

518
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,481
If only I had the power…

519
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,527
If I just had a fraction
of the power I used to have…

520
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,874
What is going on?

521
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,836
What is happening?

522
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,021
What is so funny?

523
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,356
What?

524
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,026
What is with that smile?

525
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,111
It is nothing.

526
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,780
The water is nice and cold.

527
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,032
Go fetch my clothes.

528
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,366
Right, Young Master.

529
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,411
Gosh.

530
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,126
What are you doing?

531
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,171
Here you go.

532
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,509
You may leave. Get some rest.

533
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,427
Yes, Young Master.

534
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:53,276
That Spirit Plaque will allow me
to break the barrier and enter Songrim.

535
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,822
But I cannot do that right now

536
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,990
because I do not have
the power to cast spells.

537
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,868
I should find my sword.

538
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,331
I might get my power back
if I find my sword.

539
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,253
With that Spirit Plaque,

540
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,631
I will be able to enter Songrim.

541
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,639
SONGRIM

542
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,060
How long do you plan to keep
Naksu's body at Jeongjingak?

543
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,813
If she succeeded in finding a new body,

544
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,439
Naksu…

545
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,859
will come back for her sword.

546
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,864
She will come here looking for her body.

547
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,284
Let us see how things turn out.

548
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,085
Maybe it is because
your father's room is always empty,

549
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,546
but it never seems to get dusty.

550
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,424
I wonder when he will return.

551
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,848
The colors in your mother's portrait
are starting to fade away.

552
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,934
We should call a painter
to repaint the colors.

553
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,084
I memorized all the books
you told me to read.

554
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,712
Now, teach me how to practice spells

555
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,881
just like how you taught Yul and Dang-gu.

556
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,184
That sword belongs to your father.

557
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,560
Take it out.

558
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,784
Due to the spell that has been cast on me,

559
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,370
I am unable to take out a sword
that has a spell on it.

560
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,122
You cannot even take out
your own father's sword.

561
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,874
How do you expect to learn spells?

562
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,835
Why can you not open my gate of energy
so I can practice casting spells?

563
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,836
I…

564
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,422
cannot do that.

565
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,219
Then find me another master.

566
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,346
No master can do that.

567
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:29,724
No one in Daeho will be able
to go against your father

568
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,726
and open your gate of energy.

569
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,269
Then are you saying

570
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,106
I will never have
the ability to practice spells?

571
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,148
That was

572
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:41,403
the fate given to you by your father.

573
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,239
Why!

574
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,241
Why would he decide my own fate?

575
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,869
No one even considers him
as my true father anyway!

576
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,872
I will find someone.

577
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,961
A master who will open my gate of energy
and teach me how to practice spells.

578
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,588
I will find someone myself.

579
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,342
Then I will take out that sword
and break it in two.

580
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,038
I heard Young Master Jang
got expelled again.

581
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,916
Why would the son of the great Lord Jang
always get in so much trouble?

582
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,710
He is not his son.

583
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,129
Do-hwa, the most beautiful woman in Daeho,

584
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,590
slept with another man and had Jang Uk.

585
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,800
I doubt that rumor is true.

586
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,970
Then why would he block his son
from casting spells

587
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,972
and live his life like a vagabond?

588
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:56,019
I wonder if he is really weak
because his father put a spell on him.

589
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,697
The Spirit Plaque should be
here somewhere.

590
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,463
Where is it?

591
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,782
Why did I have to hide here?

592
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,450
What will he think of me?

593
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,619
What should I say to him?

594
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,795
This was not what I had in mind
when I brought you here.

595
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:06,631
Well…

596
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,926
You kept saying you were cold,

597
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,053
so I was just heating the bedding for you.

598
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,014
If you lie down right away,
it will be nice and warm all night.

599
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,266
Is that so?

600
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,018
How kind of you.

601
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,650
-Good night, then.
-Where are you going?

602
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,195
You came to keep me warm.

603
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,240
Keep my bed

604
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,033
nice and hot

605
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,494
all night long.

606
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,747
Heat it up.

607
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,172
What? Does he really like me?

608
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,840
Have I fallen for his tricks?

609
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,099
Young Master…

610
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,644
My body is not warm enough
to keep you warm.

611
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,730
Ever since I was young,
I easily got the chills.

612
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,566
So my body temperature is always very low.

613
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,782
All right.

614
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,466
I do not plan on doing
what you want me to do.

615
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,686
Bring the brazier closer to me.

616
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:48,733
The brazier?

617
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,362
I just wanted you to bring
the brazier near my bed

618
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,530
and keep it hot.

619
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,327
Keep it hot.

620
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:06,834
Here.

621
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,295
This is too close.

622
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,090
It will be too hot.

623
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,968
Oh, right. It will be too hot.

624
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,807
I will sell you if the fire goes out.

625
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,517
Keep the fire alive all night.

626
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,726
All right, Young Master.

627
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,950
All right. Dang-gu is here.

628
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,664
What is that? It is a whistle.

629
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,249
Yes.

630
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,876
I swear I made this.

631
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,171
Oh, right. I remember.
You used to have a pet bird.

632
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,090
Why? Are you planning to get a new one?

633
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,634
No, not exactly.

634
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,636
I just found this on someone unexpected.

635
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,056
I wonder why she had it.

636
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,349
Maybe you gave it to her.

637
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,019
Maybe you forgot that you gave it to her.

638
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,186
No.

639
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,356
I clearly remember who I gave this to.

640
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,251
Then go ask her.

641
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,844
You are going to go at this hour?

642
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,346
I need to check something.

643
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,045
Who are those guys?

644
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,021
Intruders!

645
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,440
We have intruders!

646
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:58,816
Intruders!

647
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,543
Go on.

648
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,616
Out of the way!

649
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,743
Yul, what is going on?

650
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,789
The Training Center is on fire.

651
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,466
Who is at Jeongjingak?

652
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,051
Master Yul and Dang-gu.

653
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,639
Uncle, are you all right?

654
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,058
The intruders all left.

655
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:40,937
Jeongjingak is empty.

656
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,115
-Find them.
-Yes, my lord.

657
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,211
Who were those guys?

658
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:08,130
Did the Danju send them here?

659
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,595
The soul you need to collect this time
is Park Jin, the leader of Songrim.

660
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,517
Right.

661
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,812
He must have sent them here
to retrieve my body.

662
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:31,946
Who is there?

663
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,022
Young Master?

664
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:21,704
What are you doing here?

665
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,417
Because of your eyes.

666
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,461
My eyes?

667
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,777
I knew the moment I saw you.

668
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,864
You are my master.

669
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,994
The soul shifter.
Naksu, the Shadow Assassin.

670
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:48,290
I have been searching for someone who
can break this spell to call my master.

671
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,917
I want you to be my master.

672
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,627
What original nonsense.

673
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,089
They are going to catch
Naksu's men who are in here.

674
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:58,634
We will find that soul shifter.

675
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:00,845
Feign ignorance even if I get caught.

676
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,390
Stay right by my side.

677
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:08,018
The people I have met so far
only wanted me dead.

678
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,816
You are the first person
who tried to save me.

679
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:16,152
Even if we meet again
and come this close to each other,

680
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,319
I will spare you.

681
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:26,579
