1
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,429
That is the uniform
worn by Jeongjingak's mages.

2
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,508
You will maintain your dignity
as Jeongjingak's mage

3
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,734
and do your best to master spells.

4
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,244
That is the Spirit Plaque
given to Jeongjingak's mages.

5
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,781
Those who possess it

6
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,333
are given full access to everything
in Songrim and Jeongjingak.

7
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,082
That is the Book of Regulations.

8
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,003
You will follow our rules,

9
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:29,505
and if you violate them,
you will be punished accordingly.

10
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,136
Jang Uk, stand up and bow to the leader.

11
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,697
Jang Uk, turn around

12
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,615
and bow to your fellow mages.

13
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,016
From this moment forward, Jang Uk,
the eldest son of the Jang family,

14
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,320
is a mage of Songrim Jeongjingak.

15
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,806
-Hey, Uk.
-Jang Uk.

16
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,770
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

17
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,770
-You have come a long way.
-All right, everyone.

18
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:13,775
Tonight, we have a welcome ceremony
for our newest mage, Jang Uk.

19
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,490
Let us all meet up at Chwiseonru.

20
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,275
The Jang family has already paid

21
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,825
for every bottle of alcohol
and food at Chwiseonru.

22
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,541
So everyone,

23
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,964
get ready to drink until you drop.

24
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,091
Chwiseonru!

25
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,844
-Chwiseonru!
-Jang Uk!

26
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,507
I remember when Jang Gang came here
with a newborn baby like it was yesterday.

27
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,228
I cannot believe this day has come.

28
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,651
I cannot believe it either.

29
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,146
Here.

30
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,980
Eat this.

31
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,570
What is it?

32
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,275
It is a raisin tree pill.

33
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,275
Take it before you drink.

34
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,617
The kids are going to drink
until they drop.

35
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,912
The least we can do is try to keep up.

36
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,504
I do not need this to prevent a hangover.

37
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,713
You should think of your age.

38
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,507
What about my age?

39
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,878
Look. I think I see some gray hairs.

40
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,054
The sunlight is fooling your eyes.

41
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,345
My goodness.

42
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,638
Do you not see how silky my hair is?

43
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,475
Look at how beautiful my hair is.

44
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,443
I shall hold on to this.

45
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,855
Yes, take it.

46
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,260
Madam Do-hwa.

47
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,761
Young Master Jang

48
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:05,427
has become a mage of Jeongjingak,
just like Master Jang.

49
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,429
You must be thrilled.

50
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,002
You have come a long way

51
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,576
since the day we first met.

52
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,215
I knew the moment I saw you.

53
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,513
You are my master.

54
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,389
Naksu.

55
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,972
I want you to be my master.

56
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,927
What original nonsense.

57
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,767
If you survive,

58
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,692
I will be your master.

59
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,903
Master.

60
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,271
I finally did it.

61
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,385
Mu-deok.

62
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,308
How do I look? Does it suit me?

63
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,278
I am not sure. What would I know?

64
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,815
Master, how does your pupil look?

65
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,163
This uniform did not seem too bad
on Seo Yul and Park Dang-gu,

66
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,041
but it looks impeccable on my pupil.

67
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,262
That is enough.

68
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,715
I cannot breathe.

69
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,759
Master.

70
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,930
Thank you.

71
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,981
All right, Mu-deok. Let us go and drink.

72
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,236
Uk, wait.

73
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,783
-Uk--
-Young Master, you look exquisite.

74
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,655
Young Master.

75
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,038
Take this before you drink.

76
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,040
Master Heo gave you a raisin tree pill.

77
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,416
A raisin tree pill?

78
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,342
We should share it.

79
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,925
Raisin tree pills are the best
at preventing hangovers.

80
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,346
Here you go, Maidservant Kim.

81
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,901
Maidservant Kim.

82
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,532
I was going to give this to you.
I am serious.

83
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,950
Maidservant Kim, come back here.
Take this. It is as good as new.

84
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,950
Maidservant Kim, take it. Please.

85
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:22,004
The one born with the King's Star
has entered Songrim.

86
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,795
His father, Jang Gang, performed sorcery
by unsealing the ice stone,

87
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,086
and his birth was
the result of that sorcery.

88
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,885
That child is a disaster to Songrim.

89
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,259
Why do you think
Jang Gang chose to do what he did?

90
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,354
He could have made his son king

91
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,983
and used the ice stone to master Hwansu.
Then he would have ruled the world.

92
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,573
Why do you think
he closed his son's gate of energy

93
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,899
and sealed the ice stone instead?

94
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,899
Because he was weak.

95
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,739
He sealed everything and fled

96
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,163
because he did not have
what it took to handle it all.

97
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,997
Do you think Gil-ju

98
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,708
might have been killed by Jang Gang?

99
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,592
If he has returnedâ€¦

100
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,420
Jang Gang would not have done it
out in the open like that.

101
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,180
I suspect Master Lee.

102
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,064
We need to gain more power
before Songrim gets more involved.

103
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,886
Ten years ago, we succeeded

104
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,308
in getting our hands on the ice stone
that was sealed by Jang Gang.

105
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,998
You have finally found it.

106
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,329
Bu-yeon.

107
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,126
Hand over the ice stone to me.

108
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,017
She was so young,
yet she managed to find the ice stone.

109
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,479
I must admit,
her divine powers were truly astonishing.

110
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,609
I heard Jin Ho-gyeong is
unaware of her daughter's death

111
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,361
and is still looking for her.

112
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,607
That is why I plan to find her.

113
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,912
I will find the daughter
that she so longs to find,

114
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,491
and make Jin Ho-gyeong become my puppet.

115
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,788
How are you going to find a dead girl?

116
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,961
I will find someone.

117
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,749
Someone who will make her believe
that she must be her daughter, Bu-yeon.

118
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,520
Here. Eat this.

119
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,122
Have you not eaten anything
since you left Sari Village?

120
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,167
Goodness.

121
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,956
Here.

122
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,344
Eat this.

123
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,564
Eat slowly.

124
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,931
Why is a blind girl
heading to the city all by herself?

125
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,767
She is in search of a friend.

126
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,726
Her friend apparently stole
all of her things

127
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,815
and fled to Daeho Fortress.

128
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Oh, dear. Poor girl.

129
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,606
Do you even know where to go?
What is your friend's name?

130
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,826
Mu-deok.

131
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:46,081
The name of the friend
I am looking for is Mu-deok.

132
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,791
-"Mu-deok"?
-How is she going to find her?

133
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,754
Have some tasty taffy!

134
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,298
-We have fresh fish!
-Try our delicious honey biscuits!

135
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,432
-Welcome!
-Come and have a look!

136
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,339
-Take a look!
-Have some rice cakes!

137
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,678
Goodness. The weather is nice, right?

138
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,894
Mom, can you buy that for me?

139
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,685
I do not have money for that.

140
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,978
Please buy it for me.

141
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,351
What is with you today?

142
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,148
All right. Just a moment.

143
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,153
My goodness, where is it?

144
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,605
-Where is my purse?
-What is the matter?

145
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,156
My purse is gone.

146
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,124
-Dear me.
-Where is my ring?

147
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,199
-I lost my ring too!
-Oh, dear.

148
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,898
What?

149
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,744
This is it?

150
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,750
This ring is cheap too.

151
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:13,503
I chatted away,
but it was all for nothing.

152
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,322
-Thank you.
-Pour me another glass.

153
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,275
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

154
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,614
You knew who I was all along.

155
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,655
Seeing that you have it
instead of your friend,

156
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,906
I am guessing that friend is gone.

157
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,929
Young Master Seo?

158
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,345
Mu-deok.

159
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,355
What are you doing out here?

160
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,149
Are you not going to drink?

161
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,696
No. I have already had enough.

162
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,203
I am a little tipsy.

163
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,242
You seem fine.

164
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,794
I am tipsy,

165
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,406
which is why I am lost.

166
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,416
I easily get lost
whenever I am not clearheaded.

167
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,011
How can anyone get lost in here?

168
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,099
Get up. I will take you home.

169
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,768
You cut yourself, right?

170
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,358
That was dangerous.

171
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,778
Are you scolding me again?
Can you please save it today?

172
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,447
I am in no position to scold you

173
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,616
for I am also making a grave mistake.

174
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,160
You?

175
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,162
Yes.

176
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,076
I have always walked the right path.
I never did anything wrong.

177
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,965
But I have gone astray.

178
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,968
And now, I am holding your hand.

179
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,229
I do not know
which way I will end up going.

180
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,318
You will end up following me.

181
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,587
You are holding my hand.

182
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,844
Let us go.

183
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,218
The reason you get lost
when you have a lot on your mind

184
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,427
is that you are focused
on too many things.

185
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,897
When that happens,
just try to focus on one thing.

186
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,569
Right now, just focus on me and follow me.

187
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,039
All right. Right now, I will focus on you.

188
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,634
Young Master Seo, may I ask you
something that has been bothering me?

189
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,134
What is it?

190
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,974
You said that you saw an illusion of me.

191
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,394
What did that illusion say?

192
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,230
She said she was in love with me.

193
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,139
-What?
-Why are you so surprised?

194
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,898
You said that yourself quite often.

195
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,150
Well, that was becauseâ€¦

196
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,399
Was it really all a lie?

197
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,405
I am in love with you, butâ€¦

198
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,754
Yes, that is right, I am.

199
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,112
It is my token of gratitude.

200
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,498
Does he really believe that?

201
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,171
I really hope he does not.

202
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,046
That is enough.

203
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,676
This is all thanks to you, Master Heo.

204
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,389
I am sure Madam Do-hwa
would be happy as well.

205
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,232
I finally feel like

206
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,270
I have done something good
to make up for my guilt toward her.

207
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,571
You did nothing wrong.

208
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,950
I was the one who brought her
to Sejukwon from her hometown.

209
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,029
That is how she ended up
meeting Jang Gang.

210
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,118
Do-hwa was so kind at heart.

211
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,332
I cannot believe he would even think
that she would do something like that.

212
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,134
Jang Gang, that damn punk.

213
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,711
Master Heo, you are drunk.

214
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,205
This is all your fault!

215
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,925
What did I do?

216
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,349
The reason I brought Do-hwa to Sejukwon
was so I could set her up with you.

217
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,350
But what happened?

218
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,431
Goodness gracious.

219
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,229
How could you fail
to win over a woman's heart

220
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,191
with such good looks and competence?

221
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,282
You are unbelievably frustrating.

222
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,646
Yes, I remember.

223
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,317
Master Heo pretty much
set the table for you,

224
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,196
but you failed to take the opportunity.

225
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,871
I did

226
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,407
everything I could.

227
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,000
I wrote her poems.

228
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,340
I gave her gifts.

229
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,629
But you never confessed your love.

230
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,217
"I am in love with you."

231
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,680
"Will you be mine?"

232
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,890
You always circled those words,
never saying them out loud.

233
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,022
Eventually, you lost her to a man
who was much more straightforward.

234
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,350
Must you say your feelings out loud?

235
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,404
You should just be able to tell.

236
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,691
You can be very frustrating.

237
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,988
You act interested, but you stay distant.

238
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,611
Then you suddenly become intimate.

239
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,448
You need to tell a woman how you feel

240
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,583
so that she can make up her mind
and decide to wait for you.

241
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,962
If that love is fickle just because
I did not express my love out loud,

242
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,213
then I do not need it.

243
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,173
If a woman chooses to leave me
and love someone else,

244
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,133
then so be it.

245
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,843
"So be itâ€¦"

246
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,641
Enjoy the rest of the night.

247
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,773
Where are you going?

248
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,896
I am leaving.

249
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,027
Maidservant Kim.

250
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,992
Just stay here. Stay here and drinkâ€¦

251
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,532
Stay here and drink with us.

252
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,288
Maidservant Kim. Come back, all right?

253
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,289
-I will be waiting.
-My goodness.

254
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,871
-Maidservant Kim.
-He will get rejected once again.

255
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,497
Maidservant Kim!

256
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,136
So this is where worldly people drink.

257
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,772
Everyone is waiting for you.
You should go inside.

258
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,060
My training forbids me to drink alcohol.

259
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,734
I have run out of tea,
so I must return to Danhyanggok.

260
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,574
So just pack me some food.

261
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,029
I will, sir.

262
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,615
The smell of women's perfume
and the wonderful scent of alcohol.

263
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,793
This is not the kind of place for me.

264
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,804
He loves me.

265
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,585
He loves me not.

266
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,394
He loves me.

267
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,561
He loves me. He loves me not.
He loves me. He loves me notâ€¦

268
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,561
Gosh, what in the world am I doing?

269
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,194
Forget it.

270
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,445
Oh, dear! My goodness!
What am I going to do?

271
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,779
Right.

272
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,826
My gosh.

273
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,014
You are a mage.

274
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,559
Master Lee?

275
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,476
You are Master Lee, are you not?

276
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,149
I am a maid working for the Jang family.
I serve Young Master Jang.

277
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,824
Thank you.

278
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,534
No need to thank me.

279
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,123
Goodness.

280
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,054
I think it got tangled
when you held onto me.

281
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,894
Wait. Let me do it.

282
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,934
Excuse me for this.

283
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,938
All done.

284
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,284
I have been waiting for you
to show up today

285
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,574
so I could thank you for what you did.

286
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,410
There we go.

287
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,794
Where did he go?

288
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,923
Master Lee?

289
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,439
Is it because I have not taken
chaste herb tea for a while?

290
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,896
SEJUKWON

291
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,911
Master Heo is not here right now.

292
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,279
But he has been waiting for you to arrive.

293
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,372
Please come inside.

294
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,039
A welcome ceremony
for a new mage at Jeongjingak?

295
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,707
Master Heo will come home drunk.

296
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,553
We both know
how much Grandfather loves alcohol.

297
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:37,104
Young Lady,
should we also head to Chwiseonru?

298
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,557
Your future husband will be there.

299
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,266
-What?
-Madam Heo told me everything.

300
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,522
I heard your grandfather has picked out
a few mages to be your future husband.

301
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,566
Among them are Park Dang-gu,
the heir of Songrim,

302
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,781
and Seo Yul from the Seo family.

303
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,032
I am not here to get married.

304
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,663
I am here to help out
at the royal infirmary.

305
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,912
Do you think the Crown Prince
is also on the list?

306
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,464
-With your beauty--
-Sun-i.

307
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,670
Your fussing has already
embarrassed me once.

308
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,839
Have you forgotten?

309
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,720
Oh, you mean that arrogant mage?

310
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,472
We should have asked for his name
so we could tell Master Heo.

311
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,812
You are right.

312
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,771
I should have asked what his name was.

313
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,898
Are you all right?

314
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,071
I wonder if I will everâ€¦

315
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,159
get to see him again.

316
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,831
That is enough.

317
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:51,627
Uk, you owe me one,

318
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,461
so promise me this.

319
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,916
-Promise you what?
-That one day,

320
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,597
when I ask you to do something,
you will promise to do it no matter what.

321
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,971
All right. I promise.

322
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,483
Oh, wait.

323
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,808
Before you make your promise,
there is something I must clarify.

324
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:13,435
I am asking you this because
you are acquainted with Master Lee.

325
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,445
By any chance, have you been
taking the chaste herb tea for training?

326
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,740
No, I have not. Never.

327
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,157
So you are not practicing celibacy?

328
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,584
Of course not. I want to get married.
That is just ridiculous.

329
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,714
Then all is good. Here.

330
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,086
You are also a candidate now.

331
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,671
All three of you are candidates.

332
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,102
Do not forget to thank Master Lee.

333
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:45,678
If he did not vouch for you,
things would have gotten complicated.

334
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,015
Of course.

335
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,560
You almost had people
get the wrong idea about you

336
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,805
by mastering Tansu,
which was Naksu's specialty.

337
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,147
Uk even wanted to become Naksu's pupil.

338
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,197
What do you mean?

339
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,163
Pardon?

340
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:09,502
He was frustrated that he could not find
a master to open his gate of energy.

341
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,793
So he said it as a joke.

342
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,344
Did you really

343
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,205
say that?

344
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,337
Yes, I did.

345
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,797
Yul, I want you to tell him

346
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,466
what kind of punishment is given
to mages who perform sorcery.

347
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,976
If you perform sorcery,
your entire energy flow will be cut off,

348
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,598
and you will be unable to cast any spells.

349
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,435
Then you will get banished from Daeho,

350
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,823
and your descendants will never
be able to become mages.

351
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,109
Remember that.

352
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,568
Do not ever say anything like that again.

353
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,621
Why is it wrong to perform sorcery?

354
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,368
What?

355
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,463
Regular magic can kill people too.

356
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,958
On the contrary,
sorcery can help save someone's life.

357
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,843
Rather than differentiating
between the two,

358
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,799
a person's true intention behind the spell
seems a lot more important.

359
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,181
Then are you saying
you are open to using sorcery

360
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,969
if it means you could save someone's life?

361
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,015
If I can use sorcery to save someone,

362
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,233
then I do not think it would be a problem.

363
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,151
You damn boy! How dare you!

364
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,948
You are a mage of Jeongjingak.

365
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,161
How dare you say that
you are open to using sorcery?

366
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,503
If this is how you are going to be,

367
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,118
give me back
the torrent of energy I gave you.

368
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,423
-My lord.
-What is it?

369
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,552
The Crown Prince is on his way here
to meet Jang Uk.

370
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,259
Your Royal Highness.

371
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,520
Hello, Your Royal Highness.

372
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,525
The Crown Prince has arrived!
Formally greet him with respect!

373
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,603
I came because I heard
there was a celebration.

374
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,469
But it seems like I have ruined it.

375
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,104
If you think about it,
all this is being held thanks to me,

376
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,558
which makes me a welcome guest.

377
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,769
So why the heavy atmosphere?

378
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,740
I am sure that deep down inside,

379
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,609
you were wishing for my funeral
instead of a party like this.

380
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,197
So the least I can do

381
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,452
is greet you solemnly
with a straight face.

382
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,167
Whether it is a party or funeral,

383
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,460
it is always important
that there is alcohol.

384
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,213
So I brought you a jar of alcohol.

385
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,603
What if they get into another fight?

386
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,220
My lord, you should go down there.

387
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,097
Let us wait and see what happens.

388
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,027
To congratulate Uk on defeating me,

389
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,860
I will pour him a drink.

390
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,117
You have mastered Ryusu
and became a mage of Jeongjingak

391
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,372
in less than two months
since your gate of energy has opened.

392
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,172
This is to congratulate you.

393
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,167
I may have lost the duel against you,

394
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,676
but I am extremely happy
as the Crown Prince.

395
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,103
Daeho was blessed
with a great mage like you.

396
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,930
That is definitely something
worth celebrating.

397
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,806
Drink this

398
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,603
and become the best mage
that this country has ever seen.

399
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,018
Make Daeho proud.

400
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,437
Jang Uk.

401
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,329
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

402
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,918
I will also pour you a glass.

403
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,691
I hope you become
a great leader of this country.

404
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,672
Become a great leader,
Your Royal Highness.

405
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,599
Thank goodness.

406
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,147
The Crown Prince
does not hold any grudges.

407
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,164
The Crown Prince, the heir to the throne.

408
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,778
And the boy who was born
on the night of the King's Star.

409
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,088
Two of Jinyowon's precious treasures
have broken.

410
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,588
They are useless as relics,
as they no longer hold energy.

411
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,972
Burn them and throw the ashes
into Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

412
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,144
Yes, Mother.

413
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,309
Lady Jin, Master Jin has returned.

414
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,219
Father is here?

415
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,136
Cho-yeon.

416
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,185
Honey.

417
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,729
Father!

418
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,310
Father!

419
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,733
Goodness, Cho-yeon.

420
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,070
Let me see your face.
You look more beautiful than ever.

421
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,670
I am back.

422
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,004
I found her on
a volcanic island in the south.

423
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,422
She lost her parents at a young age,

424
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,677
so she has no memories of them.

425
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,760
She seems old enough to be Bu-yeon.

426
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,102
Is there anything you have had

427
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,725
ever since you were a small child?

428
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,237
Unlike Bu-yeon, she cannot detect energy,

429
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,531
and she does not know
how to cast any spells.

430
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,826
Maybe she lost her powers
while she was away from Jinyowon.

431
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,214
But if she is truly
a member of the Jin family,

432
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,665
her powers will easily come back to her.

433
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,599
This door will show us

434
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,179
whether or not you are
a true member of the Jin family.

435
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,093
Am I not the daughter
that your family once lost long ago?

436
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,930
No, I do not think so.

437
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,270
But to thank you for coming this far,
I will give you enough for your trip back.

438
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,725
Do you think Mother will get angry again
out of disappointment?

439
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,395
What should we do, Father?

440
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,041
Mother.

441
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,711
The bird inside the cage has died.

442
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,255
You are right. Poor thing.

443
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,629
Up until yesterday, I could feel
faint but warm energy.

444
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,642
But there is nothing now.

445
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,386
Although I am able to see,
you still noticed this first.

446
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,226
All living things in this world
have energy.

447
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,355
And detecting energy
is how I see the world.

448
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,991
Bu-yeon, you may not be able
to see what other people see.

449
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:48,116
But you are a special girl
who can see things that they cannot.

450
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,000
You made me a new eye mask.

451
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,042
Mother, put it on for me.

452
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,608
Honey.

453
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,903
Do not be so disappointed.

454
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,855
I brought her here
without much expectation.

455
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,033
So you just brought anyone?

456
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,247
I guess you are just
pretending to please me.

457
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,873
That is why we have failed
to find her for ten years.

458
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,285
Iâ€¦

459
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,955
I will start searching for her again.

460
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,337
Forget it.

461
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,505
Jin Mu from Cheonbugwan
will help us find Bu-yeon.

462
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:53,635
I thought you abhorred
that half brother of yours.

463
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,064
I do abhor him.
But if it means finding Bu-yeon,

464
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,904
I no longer mind
joining hands with Jin Mu.

465
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,911
-Get lost.
-Go away.

466
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,407
I am here in search of someone.

467
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,792
Mu-deok is here, right?

468
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,118
Things are busy here tonight,
so return next time.

469
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,538
You keep pushing me.

470
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,959
You must not know who I am.

471
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,173
Who are you?

472
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,175
I am a mage from one of the main families
in this country.

473
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,345
Do you want me to show you
who I am with my energy?

474
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,984
Consider yourself lucky.

475
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,153
Had I contained energy in my hand,
you would have died.

476
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,490
I apologize. Please forgive me.

477
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,243
This is just a brothel. You dare
discriminate against your customers?

478
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,914
The mages from Songrim Jeongjingak
are having a celebration inside.

479
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,575
-Songrim?
-Yes.

480
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,753
And the Crown Prince is here too,
so things were too hectic.

481
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,245
I heard she got sold
to the biggest brothel in Daeho.

482
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,760
This must be one special brothel.

483
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,929
If you tell me which family you are from,
I will announce your visit.

484
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,893
Do not bother. I will come back next time.

485
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,850
What is going on?

486
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,386
Who was that?

487
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,358
She says she is a mage
from one of the main families.

488
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,979
I think it is Jinyowon.

489
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,395
I saw her wearing something on her neck
with Jinyowon's crest on it.

490
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,696
Jinyowon?

491
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:35,866
Those mages of Jinyowon
are always busy being choosy and rude.

492
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,252
Are you all right?

493
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,119
It does not hurt that much.
She was not very strong for a mage.

494
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,998
What if she was lying?
That crest of Jinyowon might be fake.

495
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,723
If you get caught using the name
of a mage's family within Daeho Fortress,

496
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,378
you could even get killed.

497
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,470
What a suspicious woman.

498
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:07,114
I guess mages really do have
the most power inside Daeho Fortress.

499
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,529
Mu-deok must be in there somewhere.

500
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,919
I need to live off of her for a while.

501
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,543
If I tell her that I came to return this,

502
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,755
I am sure she will let me stay.
After all, she is foolishly kind.

503
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,394
-Who goes there?
-Gosh, that startled me.

504
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,690
Wait for me outside.

505
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,439
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

506
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,614
She should be out here by now.

507
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,119
One, two, three.

508
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,583
Four, fiveâ€¦

509
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,667
Your Royal Highness.

510
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,788
Your Royal Highness.

511
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,180
Once again, I was immensely touched

512
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,261
by your endless generosity.

513
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,483
Yes, I pretended to be kind and generous.

514
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,690
If I could, I would have
overturned the place.

515
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,940
But like I said, I do not want
the mages of Songrim as my enemy.

516
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,613
What? Do you think I am narrow-minded?

517
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,318
It was very wise and smart of you

518
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:41,076
to hide the petty emotions you felt.

519
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,752
I chose to share my pettiness
only with you, Filthy Mu-deok.

520
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,170
I know how unbearable it must have been
to pour him a congratulatory drink

521
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,591
when you probably wanted
to poison him instead.

522
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,550
That is why I ran out here in such a rush.

523
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,509
I hate your master so much,
it is gut-wrenching.

524
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,723
Of course.

525
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,642
My liver burns with how much I hate him.

526
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,471
Yes, I am sure.

527
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,266
And you, who support himâ€¦

528
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,386
I do not like you, either.

529
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,533
My generosity was for you, not him.

530
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,989
Filthy Mu-deok.

531
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,374
If you get involved in a fight again
between me and your master,

532
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,325
I shall kill you first.

533
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,963
Your Royal Highness,
if I ever have to die by your sword,

534
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,630
I will not resent you.

535
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,100
So you will stick by your master
no matter what?

536
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,599
What a loyal servant.

537
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,771
Should I build a memorial for you
in that outhouse?

538
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,439
Goodness, I am honored
to receive your acknowledgment.

539
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,020
Forget it. Get lost.

540
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,475
Before I lose my generosity
and become petty again.

541
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,693
-Your Royal Highness.
-What? What do you want?

542
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,107
Do you have a death wish or what?

543
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,027
Are you all right? How is your injury?

544
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,750
You could have asked quicker.

545
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,211
Do not worry.
It was not an impressive attack.

546
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,171
And Heo Yeom already treated me.

547
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,798
You were caught off guard because
you expected nothing from my young master,

548
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,341
but you clearly are
much stronger than he is.

549
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,807
Of course, I am.
Who knew Jang Uk would use Tansu?

550
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,008
That crook.

551
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,100
Oh, you mean the sachet

552
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,102
that she hung by the outhouse
to get rid of flies?

553
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,228
Where is the sachet I gave you?

554
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,187
Why do you ask?

555
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,071
I am wondering if you hung it
by the outhouse to get rid of flies.

556
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,445
I have it right here.

557
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,539
Why would I put something so precious
by the outhouse?

558
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,332
Right? I knew you would never do that.

559
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,213
All is good, then.

560
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,801
Return safely, Your Royal Highness.

561
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,442
-That is enough.
-My gosh.

562
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,521
-Young Master Jang.
-Leave me alone.

563
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,647
Will you please wake up, Your Master?

564
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,317
-Hey.
-Look at him.

565
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,532
He will stay drunk until tomorrow morning.

566
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,235
He is a lightweight.

567
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,195
But he drank every glass
that was offered by the Crown Prince.

568
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,116
Then you could have helped.
You are the only one who is fine.

569
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,996
I was busy singing.

570
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,093
Put down the palanquin.

571
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,048
Only those who are authorized by Songrim
can enter from here.

572
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,925
If you are not with Songrim, go back.

573
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,900
You cannot enter.

574
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,612
I am Mu-deok.

575
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,359
I am Young Master Jang's maid.

576
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,693
You know that.

577
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,702
Until now, you were allowed to enter
as Jang Uk's maid because he was a guest.

578
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,833
But not anymore.

579
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,499
Jang Uk is a member of Songrim,
but you are not.

580
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,366
So you may not enter.

581
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,455
Then what about Young Master Jang?

582
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,921
He is so drunk that he passed out.
I should be there to take care of him.

583
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,212
The servants of Jeongjingak
will take care of him from now on.

584
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,385
No!

585
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,716
I need to take care
of Young Master Jang by his side.

586
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,056
Please let me in.

587
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,810
You should just let her in.

588
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,483
Uk will throw a fit if he wakes up
without Mu-deok around.

589
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:41,573
Not a single Jeongjingak mage
was given the right to a personal servant.

590
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,320
Now that Jang Uk is with Songrim,
he must abide by our rules.

591
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,235
So are you saying I really cannot enter?

592
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,784
That is the rule.

593
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,620
You should go home for now.

594
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,584
I will take Uk home after he wakes up.

595
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,084
Jang Uk cannot leave.

596
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:01,249
He cannot leave Songrim
until he is done with his basic training.

597
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,836
That is also our rule.

598
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,589
Right. It was like that for us too.

599
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,335
Are you saying

600
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,388
I cannot enter
and my master cannot come outside?

601
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,352
So we cannot be together?

602
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,483
Now that you know,
you should start heading back with them.

603
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,147
Waitâ€¦

604
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,623
It is Jang Uk's first day at Jeongjingak.

605
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,207
Do you want him
to break the rules on his first day?

606
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,760
Young Masters! Please let me in!

607
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,064
If you two stay here, she will not leave.

608
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,772
If the leader finds out,
she will get punished.

609
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,023
So let us go inside.

610
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:06,404
Mu-deok, go home for now.
We will try to find a way.

611
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,698
Young Master!

612
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,289
Please take me with you!

613
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,875
Young Master!

614
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,225
My goodness gracious!

615
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,520
Grandfather, have you been well?

616
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,614
Yes, of course.

617
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,240
You have grown up to be a fine young lady.

618
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,157
Master Heo, one of the drunk mages
was brought here

619
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,619
because of his irregular breathing.

620
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,329
Goodness, he is just drunk.
You can treat him yourself.

621
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,871
He is Jang Uk.
You gave him your torrent of energy.

622
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,576
What? Jang Uk?

623
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,837
Uk?

624
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,282
He is that mage.

625
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,317
Yun-ok, come over here.

626
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,566
Yes.

627
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,706
His gate of energy remained closed
for a long time, and I opened it for him.

628
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,042
I even gave him my torrent of energy.
His name is Jang Uk.

629
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,053
"Jang Uk"?

630
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,681
Yes. It has only been a month,
but he has already mastered Ryusu.

631
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,930
He is a genius.

632
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,548
In just one month?

633
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,479
He really is amazing.

634
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,568
Well, I am quite drunk,

635
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,657
so I should go to my room and sleep.

636
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,374
Please take care of him for me.

637
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,714
Go ahead.

638
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,370
All right, Grandfather.

639
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,734
We meet again.

640
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,855
Young Master Jang Uk.

641
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,668
I have come too far to give up.

642
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,960
I will get inside no matter what.

643
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,520
Mu-deok.

644
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,614
Mu-deok.

645
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:43,831
Your young master is dying here.
My head is spinning like crazy.

646
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,582
Jang Uk.

647
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,286
If you abandon me,

648
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,378
I swear I will kill you.

649
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,281
Young Master Seo?

650
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,655
I figured you might still be here.

651
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,993
And I was right.

652
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,921
I refuse to leave.

653
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,634
I must be with my young master.

654
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,724
Waiting here will not solve anything.

655
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,470
If you stay here, Uk will break the rules.

656
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,102
Then his hard work to get into Songrim
will have been for nothing.

657
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,639
You are right.

658
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,561
For now, go home and wait.

659
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,856
I will take you home.

660
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,584
Please tell this to Young Master Jang.

661
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,663
No matter what happens,

662
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,955
I will go into Songrim,
where Young Master Jang is.

663
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,375
So tell him to hang in there.

664
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,548
All right. I will tell him that.

665
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,819
Gosh, my head hurts.

666
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,402
I blame the Crown Prince.

667
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,664
Mu-deok.

668
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,372
-Bring me some water.
-Who is Mu-deok?

669
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,369
Who are you?

670
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,337
Do you not remember me? We met at the inn.

671
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,879
Do not lie.

672
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,933
You were staring at her the entire time!

673
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,386
Right. Your name was Sun or something.

674
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,597
Yes, Sun-i.

675
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,811
Why are you here?

676
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:39,311
Young Lady Heo is the granddaughter
of Master Heo Yeom.

677
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,555
I see.

678
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,443
It is a small world, is it not?

679
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,815
If she tells Master Heo

680
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,741
about how rude you were that day,
you will get on his bad side.

681
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,658
He never liked me anyway.

682
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,870
She can tell him.

683
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,748
At least show some gratitude.

684
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,540
Young Lady Heo took care of you all night.

685
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,923
She did?

686
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,216
She must not speak of that.

687
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,267
You have met Uk before?

688
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:16,925
Yes.

689
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:21,976
Uk apparently helped Yun-ok
when she was in trouble.

690
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,403
I see.

691
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,691
Uk is not the type of person
to help someone voluntarily.

692
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,864
Why would you speak of him that way?

693
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,777
I heard you came from Wol Fortress.

694
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:38,327
Young Master Jang's mother
and I are from there too.

695
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,670
-I see.
-Maybe that is the reason why,

696
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,920
but you remind me of Madam Do-hwa.

697
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,423
I guess you and Young Master Jang
were meant to meet each other.

698
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,098
If people from the same hometown
resemble each other,

699
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,929
she should also look like you.

700
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,893
But you two look nothing alike.

701
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,481
I do not get what you mean.

702
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,322
Maidservant Kim, you are great,

703
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,700
but you sometimes exaggerate things
and jump to conclusions with no logic.

704
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,072
Are you calling me a liar?

705
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,541
I never said that.

706
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,659
Do you see what you just did?

707
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:23,116
You got overly upset
and addressed yourself as a liar.

708
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,288
All right. Fine.

709
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,705
I am a liar who easily gets upset.

710
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,875
When did I ever call you a liar?

711
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,224
That is pretty much what you are saying.

712
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,550
You keep saying that.

713
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,925
-What is with you?
-It is your faultâ€¦

714
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,851
What kind of relationship do they have?

715
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,522
They have a very vague
and peculiar relationship

716
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,773
based on affection.

717
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,225
-You got upset first.
-You said it was a lie.

718
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,276
They seem close,
but it is nothing special.

719
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,530
-You kept being sarcastic.
-But you see,

720
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,822
-he is too slow-witted.
-Just go ahead and call me a liar.

721
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,327
He is very frustrating.

722
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,408
Unbelievable.

723
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,663
We have evidence and witnesses.

724
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,705
Witnesses? Goodness, how frightening.

725
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,749
How did you end up meeting Uk?

726
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,586
-Wellâ€¦
-Young Lady Heo.

727
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,179
I apologize for interrupting.

728
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,603
Young Lady Heo, can we talk?

729
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,387
Sure.

730
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,977
You may speak here.

731
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,944
It is personal.

732
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,647
Come with me.

733
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,443
What do you think it is about?

734
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,824
Young Master Jang seemed very serious.

735
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,447
I know, right?

736
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,624
Judging by how Yun-ok followed along,

737
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,254
there must be something going on.

738
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,786
-What could it be?
-I am not sure.

739
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,168
I will go after them and find out.

740
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,378
Just leave them be!

741
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,465
Leave them be!

742
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:02,468
I mean, you guys seemed curious.

743
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,307
How can you be so slow-witted?

744
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,226
He is hopeless.

745
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,401
It is like an incurable disease.

746
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,399
Just sit down.

747
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,526
Why am I always the one getting told off?

748
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,117
What is the matter?

749
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:28,211
By any chance, did you tell anyone
about what happened that day?

750
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,752
To follow me to my accommodation

751
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,417
was rude and uncomfortable.

752
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,875
Your looks did not impress me,

753
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,894
and I did not follow you either.

754
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,545
No.

755
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,853
I would never speak of
something so embarrassing.

756
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,138
You do not think I am pretty.

757
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:50,556
My looks did not impress you,
and I know you did not follow me.

758
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,897
I feel embarrassed just thinking about it.

759
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,442
So I would never speak of it.

760
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,355
I am not

761
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,700
a woman who lacks common sense.

762
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,702
No, that was not my point.

763
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,277
The soul shifter.

764
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,118
I was talking about the soul shifter
who tried to attack you.

765
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,794
So the person who tried to attack me
really was a soul shifter?

766
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,384
Yes, but the word cannot get out.

767
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,840
So please do me a favor
and keep it a secret.

768
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,183
You saved my life,
so I will do as you ask.

769
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,101
Thank you.

770
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:26,269
We should introduce ourselves
now that we share a secret.

771
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,564
I am Heo Yun-ok.

772
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,345
I am Jang Uk.

773
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,857
I know. I heard.

774
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,729
Me too. That old manâ€¦

775
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,106
I meanâ€¦

776
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,322
Master Heo always boasts
about his granddaughter.

777
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,244
My grandfather said things about me?
What did he say?

778
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,039
You might get embarrassed.

779
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,789
You do not meanâ€¦

780
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,748
he went around telling people things like,

781
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,093
"My granddaughter is
as beautiful as a fairy."

782
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:58,049
Yes, he told everyone that
we will be blinded by your beauty.

783
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,918
But sadly, I was not.

784
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,970
This is very embarrassing.

785
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,221
I cannot believe he said that.

786
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,137
That old manâ€¦

787
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,725
I mean, that is how Master Heo
shows his affection for people.

788
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,812
He also speaks of my mother in that way.

789
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,360
Someone told me that
I resemble your mother.

790
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:23,204
I guess this is what my grandfather thinks
fairies look like.

791
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,582
What is the matter?

792
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,463
Do I not look like her?

793
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,502
I am not sure.

794
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,422
I never got to meet her.

795
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,193
How could I ever meet a fairy?

796
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,638
So it is hard to say.

797
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,858
Is your hangover gone?

798
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,740
Yes, I heard you stayed
by my side all night.

799
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,412
Yes.

800
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,829
I thought you were Mu-deok.
I apologize for the trouble.

801
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,327
I brewed some tea with medicinal herbsâ€¦

802
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,720
I hoped he would stay and have some.

803
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,354
SEJUKWON

804
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,562
Excuse me.

805
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,688
Did you see Mu-deok?

806
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,151
She came with me yesterday,
but I do not see her.

807
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,732
I am sure she went home.

808
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,572
Why would she go home without me?

809
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,081
She left her drunk master here
and went home?

810
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,078
From now on,
the servants of Songrim will tend to you.

811
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,251
Mu-deok does not belong here,
so she cannot enter.

812
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,960
Waitâ€¦

813
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,090
I guess Mu-deok thought

814
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,723
she would also be able
to follow Uk into Songrim.

815
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,888
I bet she was excited
about seeing you every day.

816
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,473
She must be disappointed.

817
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:29,624
Yes, I wonder if she is doing all right.

818
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,497
Uk must have found out.

819
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,749
He must be on his way to meet my uncle.

820
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,881
He will never approve of it.

821
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:46,673
Not a single mage was given the right
to bring in their own personal servant.

822
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,010
I cannot give you an exception.

823
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,144
Why not?

824
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,431
You exceptionally kept me out of here
for the past 20 years.

825
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,977
So why not give me another exception?

826
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:02,523
Is it because the master
who taught you Tansu

827
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,112
lives outside of these walls?

828
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,741
I am asking if you need Mu-deok

829
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,287
to communicate with that master of yours.

830
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,368
Master Lee has already proven
that I have trained myself.

831
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,212
He saved you from a crisis,
but people are still talking.

832
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,130
Some even say that

833
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:27,722
you were taught by your father, Jang Gang.

834
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,511
People spread rumors
saying he was not my father.

835
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,888
And now, they are saying
that my father taught me?

836
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,517
When there are special exceptions,
it causes people to talk.

837
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,518
You quickly mastered Ryusu and used Tansu.

838
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,534
That is not ordinary.

839
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,699
Are you

840
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,868
trying to gather attention

841
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,118
by making people talk about you?

842
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,996
I cannot make the leader
suspicious about Mu-deok.

843
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,916
He might find out she is a soul shifter.

844
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,304
All right, then.
I understand that you disapprove.

845
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,722
So you are just going to follow the rules?

846
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:17,806
Yes.

847
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,274
It took me so much hard work
to get in here.

848
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:24,401
I cannot risk getting kicked out
just because of a mere servant.

849
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,868
I want to buy Songrim's Spirit Plaque
from the black market.

850
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,249
Please get me one.

851
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,423
How could you ask me for that
when someone got killed because of it?

852
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:51,593
And if you get caught using that,
you could really get killed.

853
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:55,854
I must stay by his side.
Young Master Jang needs me.

854
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:58,808
That is not true.
He does not need you anymore.

855
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,727
He needed you when he was on the run
and busy training himself.

856
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,400
But he has entered Jeongjingak now.

857
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,569
The servants there will tend to him,

858
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,859
and the mages of Songrim
will help him train.

859
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,362
There is nothing
you can do for him anymore.

860
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,105
Why would he need you?

861
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,000
The leader put me in charge
of your basic training.

862
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:27,381
I will drop the honorifics
as I will be your teacher from now on.

863
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,014
I look forward to learning from you.

864
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,143
This is Jeongjingak's Book of Regulations.

865
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:40,178
These books teach you about the virtues
and prohibitions of mages.

866
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,016
You are banned

867
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,889
from leaving the training center
until you memorize it all.

868
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:49,149
All right. I shall follow the rules.

869
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,034
You may begin

870
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,238
by reading the books.

871
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,658
Young Master Jang.

872
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,044
Maidservant Kim.

873
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,214
How did you get in here?

874
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,749
I thought you might get locked up

875
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,337
in the secret room again
for disobeying the leader.

876
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,426
But look at you standing in a classroom.

877
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,429
I am so proud of you.

878
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,473
Maidservant Kim, you have every right
to have pride in your work.

879
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,725
You raised a fine Young Master.

880
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,904
But I must say, the tables are too low.

881
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,530
The chairs are too stiff too.

882
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,028
As you know, I am taller than others.

883
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,825
So it is uncomfortable.

884
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:44,118
But nothing can be done about it
because that is the rule.

885
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:51,753
What is your relationship
with Young Lady Heo?

886
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,706
What did you talk about with her?

887
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,296
It was nothing important.

888
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,505
I need to read all those books.
You should go now, Maidservant Kim.

889
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:05,846
Should I help you grind the ink stick
before you start studying?

890
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:09,733
No, I need to prepare
all the tools myself.

891
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,022
That is the rule.

892
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,765
I see. The rule.

893
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:14,942
All right, then.

894
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:19,198
I will leave now. Goodbye now.

895
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,284
Maidservant Kim.

896
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,697
Take good care of Mu-deok.
I bet she is worried about me.

897
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:29,287
Why would she worry
when you are doing perfectly well?

898
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,373
I bet she is happy.

899
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,671
She has been through so much
because of you.

900
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:38,223
You are very fussy with food,
but she had to cook three meals a day

901
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:41,179
up on that mountain for you.
She even had to prepare bath water

902
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,430
and wash all your clothes.
Do you know how much work that is?

903
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,101
Mu-deok really did go through a lot.

904
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:53,395
I will take her to go see flowers
and buy her something delicious.

905
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,691
I will take good care of her.

906
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,324
Mu-deok will feel comfortable
if you are not around.

907
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,199
Do you think so?

908
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,538
All right.

909
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,884
Jang Uk has already achieved his goal.

910
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,876
So he might no longer want
anything to do with me.

911
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,548
He has already abandoned 12 masters.

912
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,471
I should have poisoned him
and found something to blackmail with.

913
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,933
Maybe I trusted him too much.

914
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,563
Mu-deok!

915
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:30,391
Mu-deok.

916
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,346
Do you have the Spirit Plaque?

917
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:35,356
That I could not do.
You should take a test to enter Songrim.

918
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,025
You want me to take a test
to become a mage?

919
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,691
Are you mad? Do not be ridiculous.

920
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:44,405
No, that is not it.
Songrim is currently hiring.

921
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,450
They are even holding a contest
due to the fierce competition.

922
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:48,914
A contest?

923
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,754
RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM

924
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:53,539
They are just hiring servants.

925
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,964
Mu-deok, you are already a servant.

926
01:10:56,794 --> 01:11:00,134
Yes, I know. But I am no ordinary servant.

927
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,474
I am not doing this.

928
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,341
Why are you so angry?

929
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,256
Do you know how hard it is to pass?

930
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,271
Mu-deok, you look exhausted.

931
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,940
Have some food before you go.

932
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,685
Goodness.

933
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:19,976
Maidservant Kim.

934
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,527
Are you coming from Songrim?
Did you meet Young Master?

935
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,491
Yes, I did. He is doing very well.

936
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,658
What does the young master
want me to do now?

937
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:29,992
When is he coming for me?

938
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,157
He wants you to stay well and healthy.

939
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,416
Enjoy the flowers and eat delicious foods.

940
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:39,802
He told me to enjoy the flowers
and eat delicious foods?

941
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:40,958
Yes, he did.

942
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,891
Did he not say
when he will come to see me?

943
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,260
According to the rules,
he cannot leave the place.

944
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,518
He is determined to follow the rules now,

945
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,190
so I no longer need to worry about him.

946
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:01,979
I guess Uk has no intentions
of keeping me by his side.

947
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,284
Mu-deok.

948
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:10,950
By any chance, do you know
who Young Master Jang has feelings for?

949
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,745
I am wondering if it is the young lady
I saw at Songrim.

950
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,920
A young lady?
He is seeing someone already?

951
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,960
You see, he once told me

952
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:22,764
that his heart belongs to a woman

953
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,088
who is like a single bird egg
on top of a tall tree.

954
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,774
Apparently, he is the only one she has.

955
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,152
I could tell how much he cared about her.

956
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:46,073
When a man cares about a woman,
what do you think that means?

957
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,702
It means he is in love.

958
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:55,373
But I am Uk's bird egg.

959
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,418
They are bird's eggs.

960
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:06,633
Master, let us stay loyal
and dutiful to each other.

961
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,765
I almost died thanks to you.

962
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:16,178
My crazy master.

963
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:23,864
Our relationship as master and pupil
will only last until you become the best

964
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,491
and help me get my energy back.

965
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,531
The moment I get my energy back
and become Naksu again,

966
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,991
we will no longer be master and pupil.

967
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:36,451
Can you tell me why?

968
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:40,713
Because then, you should no longer
have a reason to protect me,

969
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,706
nor should I have a reasonâ€¦

970
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,339
to go easy on you.

971
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,343
Master! It is me, Jang Uk.

972
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,823
Gosh, this is bad.

973
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,530
What am I going to do?

974
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,163
Mu-deok.

975
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,382
I miss you so much.

976
01:14:58,076 --> 01:15:00,246
I have no intention of training Uk.

977
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,039
So you did not take him under your wing.
You just locked him up in Songrim.

978
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,634
Somebody, please help me!

979
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:08,705
It was definitely Mu-deok.

980
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:11,255
Why did she have to be away
now of all times?

981
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,420
Young Master!

982
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,392
What is there to a letter?
As long as it delivers your feelings.

983
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:22,141
Young Master Jang has a lady
he has deep feelings for.

984
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,016
This is more difficult than I thought.

985
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:26,022
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Royal Highness!

986
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,024
She was always beside Uk.

987
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:31,316
You must focus when you are trying
to read what you cannot see.

988
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:32,821
Mu-deok.

989
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:39,873
