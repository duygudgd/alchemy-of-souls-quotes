1
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,050
Here, at Cheonbugwan,
we have records of all the constellations.

2
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,388
Even the one on your birthday.
Would you like to see it?

3
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,135
Yes, Father.

4
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,559
All right. Let us go.

5
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,366
There it is.

6
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,917
My father studied stars
and kept records of them

7
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,377
as he was a constellation recorder mage
at Cheonbugwan.

8
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,682
My lady!

9
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,937
My lady!

10
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,155
My lady, stay inside and do not come out.

11
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,330
If you see your father, run away.

12
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,247
Do not let him catch you.

13
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,193
Father…

14
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,039
I will give you power.

15
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,252
Will you come with me?

16
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,217
The day my father was killed
by the four families of Daeho,

17
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,756
I followed Jin Mu.

18
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,637
I was raised
as if I was cut off from the world

19
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,515
in the deep and dangerous valleys
of Danhyanggok.

20
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,259
I do not know if I toughened up to survive

21
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,555
or if I survived because I was tough.

22
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,188
By the time my past self
and my father had been forgotten,

23
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,357
I finally returned to the world as Naksu.

24
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,525
But Naksu is dead now.

25
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,451
I have returned to this place as Mu-deok,

26
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,873
along with an incapable young master

27
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,093
who is also an unmotivated pupil.

28
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,498
How far do we have to go?

29
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,877
This bracelet weighs a ton.

30
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,014
Master, your pupil is exhausted.

31
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,721
I am done.
I am too tired to go any further.

32
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,892
I am the one carrying all the luggage.

33
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,601
I am your young master,
and you are my maid.

34
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,932
That is your job.

35
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,937
So I am your master when you are in need

36
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,227
but your maid when you need a servant?

37
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,363
Of course.

38
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:19,986
I did not know

39
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,993
there was a place like this
right outside the city.

40
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,782
This is a place so rugged and remote
that even echoes cannot be heard.

41
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,200
Hence the name, Danhyanggok.

42
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,842
I hear the echoes just fine.

43
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,208
It was a figure of speech.

44
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,705
The name is just a bluff.

45
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,256
I am hungry.

46
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,257
Up there is where I used to live.

47
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,564
You will eat what I provide for you

48
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:51,178
and sleep where you collapse
after a hard day's training.

49
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,899
What is this? I smell chicken.

50
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,494
-Do they sell chicken here?
-Who would sell chicken here?

51
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,491
You smell chicken too, right?

52
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,243
I am telling you. It is chicken.

53
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,535
I am sure it is chicken. I love chicken.

54
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,909
How did you climb up there?

55
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,705
Someone must be cooking chicken nearby.

56
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,462
Come on down. Why are you up there?

57
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,797
See? It is chicken.

58
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,927
I told you I smelled chicken.
It is so nice here!

59
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,373
Why are these things here?

60
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,327
Mu-deok!

61
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,294
There is even a bath here!

62
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,680
Mu-deok.

63
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,932
There are tons of things to eat,
and the bathtub is nice too.

64
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,175
Master, you had yourself
a pretty nice place.

65
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,518
Did you really have to
scare your pupil like that?

66
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,443
You are one weird…

67
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,193
There is even a blanket.

68
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,743
This is so soft. It is nice and comfy.

69
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,033
These are not mine.

70
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,371
Someone else is living here.

71
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,875
Mu-deok.

72
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,338
Should we eat the chicken?
I noticed that it was nicely cooked.

73
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,590
Mu-deok?

74
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,763
Is it a man?

75
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,656
Quiet! Stop!

76
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,995
Stay still.

77
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,425
Good boy.

78
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,350
You are well-trained. Do you live here?

79
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,474
He is not a stray dog.

80
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,723
Where is your owner?

81
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,518
Hey, Fluffy. Go bring your owner.

82
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,729
What a clever dog.

83
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,398
Who could it be?

84
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,945
It cannot be one of Danju's men,

85
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,278
seeing that this person is
not trying to hide him or herself.

86
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,041
There is tea.

87
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,158
We are guests, so it would not be rude
to have a cup, right?

88
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,916
Watch what you eat or drink.

89
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,748
We need to check who lives here first.

90
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,625
Then we will decide what to do next.

91
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,962
So you really have no idea?

92
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,419
What?

93
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,797
There is a dog, a bunch of flowers,

94
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,804
roasted chicken, and a pot of tea.

95
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,176
I almost had the wrong idea.

96
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,635
What do you mean?

97
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,022
I almost misunderstood you for trying
to kidnap and make me live with you

98
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,561
on the pretense of training me.

99
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,444
If that dog wagged its tail at you,

100
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,151
I would have thought that
this was all part of your plan.

101
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,362
This place is big enough
for two or three kids.

102
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,948
It was not like this when I lived here.

103
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,909
It was completely barren

104
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,579
and perfect for training,
which is why I brought you here.

105
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,449
So just for training?

106
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,157
Was that all you had in mind?

107
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,292
Forget it! Go ahead
and eat or drink whatever you wish

108
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,495
and get yourself killed.

109
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,166
Unbelievable.

110
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,924
I cannot believe she would say that to me
just because I made a joke.

111
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,178
I was a fool to have followed her
all the way here.

112
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,721
Goodness.

113
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,266
Just stay a clueless Young Master

114
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,494
of the Jang family.

115
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,702
I would rather live here

116
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,368
than live that way.

117
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,543
Today, the leader of Jinyowon

118
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,463
has gathered the mages of Daeho
to hold a Unanimous Assembly.

119
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,461
All 11 families have gathered
aside from Jang Gang of the Jang family.

120
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,466
Is my duel with Jang Uk
that big of a deal?

121
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,471
It is a duel between
a royal family member and a mage.

122
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,353
The last one was hundreds of years ago.

123
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,970
I am merely trying to punish Jang Uk

124
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,138
for having looked down on me.

125
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,597
This is not a personal matter.

126
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,229
His Majesty gave his orders,
and the mages have gathered.

127
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,985
If they agree to this duel,
the fight will become official.

128
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,279
A crack has formed
and damaged the stability and peace

129
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,577
that had existed
between the royal family and mages.

130
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,843
Did you really agree with depriving
Uk's right to become the next Gwanju?

131
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,433
Yes, it is true.

132
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,481
This duel is merely to resolve

133
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,111
the misunderstanding
between the Crown Prince and Uk.

134
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,438
As for the Gwanju position,

135
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:17,815
I already have someone else in mind
other than Jang Uk to recommend for it.

136
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,743
Having it taken away
is different from giving it up.

137
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,118
I heard Jang Uk ran away
before he even received the duel offer.

138
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,708
How embarrassing.

139
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,208
He should fight honorably
and die as a mage with integrity.

140
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,542
Uk does not have the guts to do that.

141
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,882
Everyone here has been his master.

142
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,585
-Right.
-He never had any kind of potential.

143
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,176
I do not wish for us mages
to be disgraced like this.

144
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,933
What if we disqualify Uk
of his rights as a mage?

145
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,687
If we disqualify his rights
followed by a unanimous vote,

146
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,032
his energy flow will be cut off,
and he will lose all his power.

147
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,819
Are you suggesting we ruin
the young man's life forever?

148
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,744
Still, it will help us stop the duel.

149
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,906
Uk's gate of energy was closed anyway
thanks to his father.

150
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,914
-He is right.
-He has a point.

151
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,076
All of you here

152
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,285
have once taught Uk as his master.

153
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,051
How could you be so nonchalant

154
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,261
about ruining the life of someone
who once used to be your pupil?

155
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,388
Songrim has accepted
the royal family's duel.

156
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,393
Songrim will take on the disgrace
that may or may not occur.

157
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,556
Then make sure it becomes an official duel
between Songrim and the royal family.

158
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,228
I will.

159
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,701
I heard Uk mastered Ryusu
in a very short amount of time.

160
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,276
Was he taught by someone in Songrim?

161
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,333
No matter where he goes,
whether it is Songrim or not,

162
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,629
there will be no master for Uk.

163
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,684
The water is nice and clean.
My skin feels so soft.

164
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,050
Maybe it is mineral water.

165
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,390
Mu-deok, the owner of this place
seems like a very neat person.

166
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,984
I do not think he will be back…

167
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,519
Goodness.

168
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,578
She is completely knocked out.

169
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,825
Of course, you are tired.

170
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,535
We could have taken our time,
but you insisted on hurrying.

171
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,586
You are Mu-deok now, not Naksu.
You do not have the strength.

172
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,931
Oh, gosh. This is…

173
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,801
This is heavy.

174
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,428
What a fool.

175
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,394
If it was this heavy,
she should have asked for help.

176
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,735
It is so comfy.

177
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,282
I am a young master,

178
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,451
and she is my maid. That is right.

179
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,672
It is only right that I sleep here.

180
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,472
Gosh, this is making me feel uneasy.

181
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,074
All right.

182
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,368
Master.

183
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,866
Please get a good night's rest.

184
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,109
This is so uncomfortable.

185
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,930
Are you saying
there is a soul shifter inside?

186
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,191
How interesting.

187
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,258
I would not have recognized her
without your help

188
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,931
since her soul has no malice.

189
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,845
You will be better off dying in my hands
than to run wild and be petrified.

190
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,465
A great soul has shifted into this body.

191
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:18,181
She should have run wild by now,
judging by how weak this body looks.

192
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,183
How is she still fine?

193
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,858
I feel no energy around her.
Where did it all disappear to?

194
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,276
Who are you?

195
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,160
And you are?

196
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,247
Step away from Mu-deok.

197
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,095
That sword was given
to the Cheonbugwan's Gwanju by the king.

198
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,970
Who are you?

199
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,807
What are you doing with a girl like her?

200
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,942
Mu-deok, run!

201
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,612
Hey, you are up.

202
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,240
Who is he?

203
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,617
The man you saw last night.

204
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,246
The man I saw last night?

205
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,541
Yes. Do you not remember?

206
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,545
Mu-deok, run!

207
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,581
I apologize about last night.

208
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,497
I saw someone inside the hut,

209
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,586
and you suddenly wielded your sword at me,
so I had no choice.

210
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,012
I was startled too.

211
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,681
I am not trained enough
to control the energy in my arm.

212
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,640
I had no intentions of harming you.

213
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,850
Did you two…

214
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,724
fight?

215
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,854
Do you not remember anything
from last night?

216
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,316
No.

217
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,938
You stood right there
and watched us fight.

218
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,276
I did?

219
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,241
What?

220
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,612
I guess you sleepwalk.

221
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,277
I will get you medicinal herbs for that.
Brew them and drink the tea.

222
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,370
Are you a herbalist?

223
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,543
No, but he is staying here
to pick some medicinal herbs

224
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,252
that are only found in Danhyanggok.

225
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,252
Call me Master Lee.

226
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,004
There is enough
food and space for all of us,

227
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,956
so make yourselves at home.

228
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,881
All right, Sapsali.

229
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,558
Do you really not remember?

230
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,638
Did I really sleepwalk last night?

231
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,914
I swear I was on the floor…

232
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,449
That soul shifter is special.

233
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,743
There is a great soul
dwelling inside that small body.

234
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,998
Let us get to know her a bit.

235
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,542
Do not lie.

236
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,205
I am serious. I moved you
so you could sleep comfortably.

237
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,665
What is your relationship?

238
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,633
Are you married?

239
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,926
-No.
-No.

240
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,045
You did not put me on the bed.
I remember sleeping on the floor.

241
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,178
Why would I lie to you? I really--

242
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,555
-You always lie.
-They must be married.

243
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,635
-We are not.
-We are not.

244
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,807
So did you win?

245
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,436
No, I lost. But…

246
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,685
He is very strong.

247
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,994
-He is--
-Good for you. I knew it.

248
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,108
What?

249
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,829
They even held a gathering.
Things are getting out of hand.

250
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,251
Do you think Uk and Mu-deok are all right?

251
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,001
They went to Sari Village,
Mu-deok's hometown.

252
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,253
She must be happy.

253
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,666
Why would she be happy?

254
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,875
She had to leave you.

255
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,224
-So?
-Goodness, you fool.

256
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,220
Mu-deok is in love with you.

257
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,216
She only said that

258
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,480
so she could help Uk.

259
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,268
Sure. Whatever.

260
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,191
I heard Young Master Jang ran away.

261
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,404
He did not run away.
He just fled to take refuge.

262
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,947
What is the difference?

263
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,700
Does that mean
he went to Danhyanggok with Mu-deok?

264
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,656
-Danhyanggok?
-Yes.

265
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,115
She lit firecrackers there recently
under Young Master Jang's orders.

266
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,787
I remember seeing the fireworks
from the fortress.

267
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,956
I figured that was where they went
since it is not too far away.

268
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,716
-Did I guess correctly?
-No.

269
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,679
Mu-deok took him
to Sari Village, her hometown.

270
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Oh, I see. Sari Village.

271
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,965
Do not tell anyone that Uk is there.

272
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,226
All right. I will not.

273
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,428
Enjoy.

274
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,943
Mu-deok used to go to Danhyanggok?

275
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,522
That place is pretty dangerous.

276
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,937
Is that the place
where you kept your pet bird?

277
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,702
You hurt your leg there
and worried everyone.

278
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,065
Yes, it was Danhyanggok.

279
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,412
I had forgotten all about that place.

280
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,221
The fire is weak.

281
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,894
His body must be filled with energy,
judging by his strength.

282
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,604
He has mastered Jipsu.

283
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,610
Jipsu? That means he is as strong as I am.

284
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,071
No wonder it was not easy to fight him.

285
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,789
He is using his energy to control fire.

286
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,962
He is far above

287
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,004
the Ryusu level.

288
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,133
RYUSU: THE STAGE OF EMITTING
ENERGY FROM THE BODY

289
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,671
Ryusu?

290
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,416
He is stronger than I am.
I could have gotten badly hurt.

291
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,471
The rain has soaked my clothes.

292
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,696
He has mastered Chisu.

293
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,417
He dried his clothes so easily.

294
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,129
He is a master
of the higher levels of Chisu.

295
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,545
A master of levels beyond Chisu?

296
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,304
I could have died.

297
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,483
It is nice and dry.

298
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,815
Do not drink that tea.

299
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,084
You drank the entire pot?

300
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,159
Yes.

301
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,334
Are you all right? Do you feel unwell?

302
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:29,997
Did you brew poisonous herbs?

303
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,287
No, not poisonous herbs.

304
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,667
Chaste herbs.

305
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,003
Chaste?

306
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,338
Chaste herbs?

307
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,973
You mentioned picking herbs
that grow only in Danhyanggok.

308
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,391
Did you mean chaste herbs?

309
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,520
You know about chaste herbs?

310
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,558
I heard that there were mages
who drink tea made with chaste herbs

311
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,983
to lower their libido so they could focus
on mastering their spells.

312
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,068
Lower their libido? What is that?

313
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,700
Your sexual desire,
one of the five desires of humans.

314
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,278
What? Sexual desire?

315
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,081
Chaste herbs cut off…

316
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,788
the energy that causes humans
to have sexual desires.

317
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,790
I heard about a mage
who reached a high level of sorcery

318
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,508
by cutting off his libido
and mastering spells.

319
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,759
They say he only wears clothes
made with hemp fabric,

320
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,052
which is why they call him,
"Hemp Master Lee."

321
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,847
You really do know a lot of things
for a mere maid.

322
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,687
I am honored to have met a mage
who has reached such a high level.

323
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,190
Here is a proper greeting,
Hemp Master Lee.

324
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,784
Young Master.

325
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,787
What are you doing? Greet him properly.

326
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,214
Does this mean my libido has been cut off?

327
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,705
No…

328
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,795
No way.

329
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,419
No…

330
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,051
That cannot happen. Please help me.

331
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,644
A single pot of tea is not enough
to cut off your libido.

332
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,560
Are you sure? Tell me the truth!

333
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,639
Yes, it is the truth.
If you are so worried,

334
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,194
I will make you a tonic
to help boost it back.

335
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,765
Thank you.

336
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,856
Master Lee.

337
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,691
Can you help my young master?

338
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:25,157
He is struggling to control the energy
that is focused on his right arm.

339
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,160
Can you help him control it?

340
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,914
Teaching him would not be hard,

341
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,955
but if you wish to learn from me,
you must do as I say.

342
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,250
Are you ready for that?

343
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,753
He is ready to do anything.

344
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,745
Right?

345
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:43,046
What exactly do I need to do?

346
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,262
Just like me,

347
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,471
you must drink chaste herb tea.

348
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,182
Are you willing to cut off…

349
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,941
your libido?

350
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,153
You drank the whole pot?

351
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,650
Yes.

352
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,820
You can do it, right?

353
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,998
So what if he is a renowned mage?

354
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,804
He is stuck here all by himself
without a pupil for a good reason.

355
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,880
His method will speed things up.

356
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,143
You will quickly be able to control
that energy in your arm.

357
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,809
Listen. He wants me to drink
that chaste herb tea. That is ridiculous.

358
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,350
I am already bothered
by how much I drank yesterday.

359
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,856
I wonder if this tonic
will be enough to undo it.

360
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,768
It is not entirely ridiculous.

361
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,860
Cutting off your libido is not a bad idea

362
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:47,323
if you will not be needing it for a while.
It is a good way to train.

363
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,699
Are you saying
I will not be needing it for a while?

364
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,674
Mu-deok, look me in the eye and tell me.

365
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,250
Yes! Is that a problem?

366
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,295
Think about it.
This is a rare opportunity.

367
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,588
It takes a lot of luck
to meet someone like him.

368
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,262
Just practice celibacy for a while

369
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,301
and get rid of this.

370
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,885
Do not make it sound like
a walk in the park.

371
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,021
Impotence is a small sacrifice
for a high-level mage.

372
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,888
See? Listen to what you just said.

373
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,435
You do not care
if my libido will be cut off forever.

374
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,979
Stop fussing over what is useless.

375
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,113
It is precious to me
regardless of its use!

376
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,866
Hey…

377
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,663
Mu-deok, are you all right?

378
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,287
What just happened?

379
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,254
Ryusu.

380
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,965
The energy within you has trickled out.

381
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,886
A small amount of energy
created immense strength.

382
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,509
If you took off the binding bracelet
and used your full force,

383
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,387
I would have died on the spot.

384
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,604
Hey, you are bleeding.

385
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,033
Master, you must be crazy.

386
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,109
-Do you enjoy almost dying?
-Yes.

387
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:11,114
It means you are getting stronger.

388
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,081
Right now, it may seem insignificant,

389
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,372
but your energy will soon add up,

390
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,546
and your power will be as awe-inspiring
as Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

391
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,092
Then I will also be able
to regain my power.

392
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,070
Wipe that blood off
before it fills up Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

393
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,316
It must hurt.

394
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,034
Not at all.

395
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,624
Stop acting tough.

396
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,405
Year one of the King Go Sun regime.

397
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,877
The first day of April.

398
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,763
GO SUN, YEAR ONE
FIRST DAY OF APRIL

399
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,301
The King's Star was in the night sky
the night the baby was born.

400
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,006
No one can find out about that star.

401
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,597
But Cheonbugwan would have
kept a record of it.

402
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,023
I have managed to sneak out
the actual plate.

403
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,442
The one in Cheonbugwan is…

404
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,193
a fake one without the King's Star.

405
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:33,026
You must not let anyone find out
the secret behind his birth.

406
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,238
Do you see a strange constellation there?

407
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:53,218
It is the day that Lady Do-hwa died
and Jang Uk was born.

408
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,638
I heard about the gathering.

409
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:03,136
All you noble mages
must have had to gather because of me.

410
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,227
Assistant Gwanju.

411
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,862
Why not start your own family line?

412
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,690
If you receive a unanimous vote,

413
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,368
you can also become a noble member
of the Unanimous Society yourself.

414
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,497
I am a member of the Jin family.
Jinyowon is my birthplace.

415
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,422
What brings you to Cheonbugwan?

416
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,002
The soul shifter found in Songrim

417
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,297
was a constellation recorder mage
in Cheonbugwan.

418
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,468
The Jeongjingak mages
must carry out an investigation,

419
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,386
so please cooperate.

420
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,055
Investigate what?

421
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,730
Why do you want to know?
So you can hide things in advance?

422
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,315
I have nothing to hide.

423
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,283
They are welcome anytime.

424
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,366
They are already here.

425
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,640
That mage's job was

426
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,687
to continuously maintain
the right amount of energy in here.

427
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,401
He was in charge of this section.

428
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,369
What? There is a dead body in Cheonbugwan?

429
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,674
Eunuch Kim absorbed a man's energy,
and the body is in the secret room.

430
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,810
The soul shifter's job here
was nothing important.

431
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,981
He was also warned for secretly
looking at the constellation plates.

432
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,396
My lord.

433
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,863
A lot of the officials
seem to have suddenly disappeared.

434
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,315
Where could they have gone?

435
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,698
Thank you for your cooperation.

436
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,792
Do not mention it.

437
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,133
I have one more favor to ask.

438
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,631
This may be out of line,

439
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,970
but I would like to take a look
at the secret room inside Cheonbugwan.

440
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,613
Feel free to look around.

441
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,680
Use the underground tunnel
to take the corpse out.

442
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,821
If they are hiding something,
they will try to get rid of it.

443
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,275
Watch and follow his men.

444
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,579
Let us hurry.

445
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,887
We saw this wagon exiting Cheonbugwan.

446
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,759
Are you a mage there?

447
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,966
Show us your face.

448
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,266
Let us see what is inside.

449
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,812
Go after him!

450
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,439
The man I fought just ran away.

451
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,359
Did you lose the wagoner?

452
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,873
I found this inside.

453
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,951
That is Songrim's Spirit Plaque.

454
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,907
Were those men from Songrim?

455
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:15,596
The Spirit Plaque of Songrim
was found inside the wagon,

456
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,771
so they will not be able
to raise an issue.

457
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,347
Naksu ended up helping us
even after she died.

458
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,897
I apologize for the trouble
I have caused, Assistant Gwanju.

459
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,445
You attacked a person
in the middle of the street?

460
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,374
I shifted your good-for-nothing soul
into a man of power,

461
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,834
but it was not so you could act out.

462
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,084
Forgive me.

463
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,837
Deliver this chest.

464
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,182
Make sure they receive it as always.

465
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,524
I will make sure
it is delivered right away.

466
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,105
He will have to be discarded soon.

467
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,907
Find me another eunuch.

468
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,080
Then I will shift your soul into his body.

469
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,751
Into the body of a eunuch?

470
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,417
What is the matter?
Is it not to your liking?

471
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,546
I shall follow your orders.

472
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,723
Do you still safely carry around
the Soul Ejector?

473
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,723
Yes.

474
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,774
I was going to refrain from shifting souls
because of Songrim's vigilance.

475
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:54,696
But it seems to be the only way
to serve Her Majesty.

476
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,791
An item that belongs to Songrim
was found in a suspicious wagon

477
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,962
that was coming out of Cheonbugwan.

478
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,921
So it gives us no right
to raise an issue about it.

479
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,883
Find out whose Spirit Plaque this is.

480
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:16,434
As you all know,
Uk recently lost his Spirit Plaque.

481
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,431
And judging by that burn mark,
I think it belongs to him.

482
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,097
This is Uk's?

483
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:27,313
I cannot believe him. He does not fail
to cause trouble even when he is not here.

484
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,146
I want you two to visit Uk

485
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:33,151
and ask him where and how
he lost this Spirit Plaque.

486
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,276
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

487
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,411
This is from Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju.

488
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,504
What is it that the Assistant Gwanju
always sends to you?

489
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,552
He sends me medicinal herbs
for the sake of my good health.

490
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,840
He may not look it,
but he is a thoughtful man.

491
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,738
Mu-deok.

492
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,409
I am going to go with Master Lee
to pick medicinal herbs.

493
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,528
When will you train?

494
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,534
I should earn my keep to stay here.
I will see you later.

495
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,987
-Let us get going.
-Right.

496
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,658
Does it really have a great view?

497
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,536
-The view is magnificent.
-I cannot wait to see it.

498
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,259
Master Lee, you are very dexterous.

499
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,140
I buy everything
and just put them together. Hold it.

500
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,258
-Like this?
-Yes.

501
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:27,768
This is nice.

502
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,062
Today, we will go to a place
with tons of mandarin fish.

503
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,397
Mandarin fish? Then we should
prepare ingredients for the fish stew.

504
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,823
Do you know how to cook it?

505
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,861
No, but you can teach me how.

506
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,609
Why, you…

507
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,964
It is a bit salty.

508
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,341
Mu-deok, have a taste.

509
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,803
Young Master, are you here to mess around?

510
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,635
What are you doing?

511
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,599
Master Lee has a lot to teach.

512
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,101
Who told you to learn things like this?

513
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,193
If you wish to learn from him,
do it right.

514
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,559
Mu-deok, I think I am fit
to live in the wild.

515
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,266
Thank you for bringing me

516
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,936
to such a peaceful place.

517
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,697
Are not even worried…

518
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,912
about the duel with the Crown Prince?

519
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,366
If you are so worried, go find out.

520
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,290
It is salty.

521
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,379
Hey!

522
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,253
My gosh!

523
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,473
Mu-deok, put down that knife.

524
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,352
You better not throw it at me.

525
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,055
I said I would kill you
if you become useless.

526
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,268
You cannot kill me.

527
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,526
I have mastered Jipsu,
and you are just Mu-deok.

528
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,153
You are no longer Naksu.

529
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,492
Hey! That is dangerous!

530
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,040
You and I have no need
for peace and serenity in our lives.

531
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,329
I will destroy it for you.

532
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,205
What is the matter with you?

533
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,415
Who are you to stop me
from enjoying my peace?

534
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,376
Are you satisfied with this life?

535
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,514
Yes, I am.

536
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,513
I am very satisfied.
If you do not like it, then you can leave.

537
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,516
I am happy with my life here,

538
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,558
but if you do not feel the same way,
you may leave.

539
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,225
You jerk.

540
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,443
You know we are both connected by fate.

541
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,244
And you are asking me
to be the one to end it.

542
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,361
You coward.

543
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,964
Damn it.

544
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,404
I have found a way for Uk

545
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,190
to avoid a duel with the Crown Prince
and still become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.

546
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,903
What is it? We are ready to do anything.

547
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:33,541
By having Uk marry my daughter, Cho-yeon.

548
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,753
Our family owns a plaque
that gives us the power

549
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,667
to reject the King's orders.

550
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,351
We even have the power
to dethrone the King

551
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,770
if all the mages in Daeho
unanimously vote for it.

552
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,556
This plaque was granted to us
by the Unanimous Assembly

553
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:06,187
to prevent the rare and dangerous spirits
inside Jinyowon from escaping.

554
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:11,487
Are you offering to go against
His Majesty's order to deprive Uk

555
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,454
of becoming the next Gwanju?

556
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,993
Yes, but only if he marries my daughter

557
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,500
and becomes a member of the Jin family.

558
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:26,002
But Lady Jin and Young Master Jang
have already once

559
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,010
called off their engagement.
Are you all right with that?

560
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,636
It was not because
my feelings for him had faded.

561
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,724
I still wish to marry Uk.

562
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,443
I did not expect him to wed so soon.

563
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,612
I am not sure
if he is ready to get married.

564
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,287
You do things pretty well
for someone from a wealthy family.

565
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,500
Once I put my mind to something,
I tend to learn very fast.

566
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,791
I like you even more now.

567
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,089
You should reconsider becoming my pupil.

568
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,128
Master Lee, do you not have any pupils?

569
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,593
I had one,

570
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,678
but he gave up on celibacy
and got married.

571
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,560
He works at an infirmary now.

572
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,573
You can always
change your mind and go back.

573
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,782
So think about it.

574
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,905
I did not come here to train.

575
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,781
Do you really want to waste that energy

576
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,538
on just fishing
and picking medicinal herbs?

577
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,752
-I cannot control it anyway.
-Is that so?

578
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,921
That arm will become a burden
if you leave it like that.

579
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,342
Shall I cut off your energy flow?

580
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,394
Then you will be able to live
an average and comfortable life.

581
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,155
I need to go to the fortress.
Would you like to come with me?

582
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,161
No, I will pass today.
I need to cook for Mu-deok.

583
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,420
She is not here.
She went down the mountain earlier.

584
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,745
What?

585
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,674
Jang Uk is a real genius

586
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,054
and has already mastered Ryusu.

587
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,721
And he is training hard
to get ready for the duel.

588
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,264
Spread that rumor around the city,
word-for-word.

589
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,387
Really?

590
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,848
If he still does not show up,
he will completely lose face.

591
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,024
Then at least he will feel humiliated.

592
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,981
Give me some chicken.

593
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,646
You should leave today.
Cheonbugwan officials are here.

594
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,695
Someone high-up came to visit us today.

595
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,490
It is best not to run into them,

596
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,123
especially with
the Spirit Plaque incident.

597
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:21,966
Stop right there.

598
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,403
You are Jang Uk's maid, are you not?

599
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,270
Yes, I am. Do you need something?

600
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,486
There is no way Naksu would have
shifted her soul into a body like that.

601
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,704
You…

602
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:42,744
Do you remember seeing me
at the inn by the dock?

603
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,552
I am not sure.

604
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,965
He is suspicious of me.

605
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,064
I have a few questions for you.
Come with me to Cheonbugwan.

606
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,515
Follow me.

607
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,692
-Get off me!
-Stay still!

608
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,190
-Why are you…
-Stay still!

609
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,728
She has no blue mark.

610
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,147
Is she really not Naksu?

611
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:24,282
I do not know where Young Master Jang is.

612
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,039
Your Royal Highness!

613
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,128
Your Royal Highness.

614
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,923
Your Royal Highness, it is me.

615
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,375
It is me, Filthy Mu-deok.

616
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,439
You are Filthy Mu-deok.

617
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,940
Yes, that is me. You granted me that name.

618
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,574
I am Filthy Mu-deok.

619
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,658
Your Royal Highness, please help me.

620
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,869
Help you with what?

621
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,579
Your Royal Highness, you are
not only intelligent but also strong.

622
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,911
Meanwhile, my young master is
dumb and pathetic.

623
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,786
Because of him, my life is at stake.

624
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,633
Please help me, Your Royal Highness.

625
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,681
Thank you very much, Your Royal Highness.

626
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,601
What is your dumb, pathetic young master
up to these days?

627
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,891
He spends every day crying.

628
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,015
He is terrified of you,
so he shakes in fear

629
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,853
and weeps in hiding.

630
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,527
I see you are speaking ill of him
just so you can please me.

631
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,952
I can say things
that are a lot worse if it pleases you.

632
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,704
Filthy Mu-deok,
you must think I am a petty man.

633
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,204
I am filthy for a reason.

634
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,077
Relieve yourself of everything
you have wanted to say but could not,

635
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,915
thinking it might make you seem petty.

636
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,375
Are you offering to be
a verbal outhouse of sorts?

637
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,222
Goodness, that would be
too grand of a title for me.

638
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,088
But I would be more than honored.

639
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,507
I do not need someone like you
to relieve my stress.

640
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:13,181
Your Royal Highness,
I know you have done enough,

641
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,688
but can you please tell those men
not to drag me away again?

642
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,815
A warning will be enough.

643
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,070
Take this.

644
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,744
That is my sachet.

645
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,997
SACHET: A SCENTED BAG

646
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,368
Show them that if your pathetic master
puts you in trouble again.

647
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,712
My goodness.
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

648
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,514
It smells of cinnamon.

649
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,393
Why do you look disgusted by the smell?

650
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,560
What is the matter? Do you not like it?

651
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,178
Nonsense. I really like it.

652
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,392
-Give it back then.
-No.

653
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,517
It is already covered in my filth.

654
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,565
I am grateful
for this wonderful-smelling gift.

655
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,605
Then let me pour you a glass of alcohol
that also smells wonderful.

656
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,293
It is cinnamon and ginger wine,

657
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,674
made with plenty of cinnamon.

658
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,263
You must not like the smell.
I will take it back.

659
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:25,881
No.

660
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,175
I like it.

661
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,558
-How does it taste?
-It tastes wonderful.

662
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,606
Have another glass.

663
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,566
Mu-deok probably went to Chwiseonru.
She has nowhere else to go.

664
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,867
Did she get angry and leave?

665
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,543
What kind of maid is that?

666
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,825
She is no ordinary maid.

667
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:02,787
If she is no ordinary maid,
then what exactly is she?

668
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,131
Mu-deok is like a bird's egg.

669
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,844
She needs to be embraced.

670
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,432
-Let us go and look.
-What is it?

671
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,641
They found the corpse of a soul shifter.

672
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,521
-A soul shifter's corpse?
-Where?

673
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,266
-Let me see.
-What happened?

674
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,154
-My goodness.
-Oh, dear.

675
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,071
-It looks horrible.
-Goodness gracious.

676
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,988
That is not a soul shifter.

677
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,993
But he died because of one.

678
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,201
You know about soul shifters?

679
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,826
When soul shifters run wild,
they feed off the energy of humans.

680
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,374
That is why they banned
the alchemy of souls

681
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,838
and started capturing
and killing soul shifters.

682
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,308
Do all soul shifters run wild?

683
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,640
Not if they master Hwansu.

684
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,521
Is that level even possible
for a human being to master?

685
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,805
Of course.

686
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,990
Would you like to be my pupil
and reach that level?

687
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,199
You are not only well-built and smart,

688
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,160
but you also have what it takes.

689
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:18,504
Thank you for the compliment,
but I do not wish to be celibate.

690
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,788
If you become my pupil,

691
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,371
I will teach you how to take off
that binding bracelet.

692
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,037
"Master."

693
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,457
That is all it takes.

694
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,298
Please stop trying to convince me.

695
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,381
We are from Cheonbugwan.
Everyone, step away.

696
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,391
I should get going.
It is bad for me to run into them.

697
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,268
Goodness.

698
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,987
Look over there.

699
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,622
-It is a rainbow.
-Where?

700
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,328
-Oh, my goodness.
-It is a rainbow.

701
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,749
-It really is a rainbow.
-Beautiful.

702
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,918
-Look at that.
-It has been so long.

703
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,463
-How beautiful.
-Look.

704
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,843
-It really is a rainbow.
-Where did the wagon go?

705
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,417
It was right here a minute ago.

706
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,755
-Where did it go?
-Where is the wagon?

707
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,869
I am surprised to hear my voice echo
in Danhyanggok.

708
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,881
Nice.

709
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,929
What? Mu-deok is drunk?

710
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,049
Are you saying she has been drinking here?

711
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,306
She almost got dragged
to Cheonbugwan today.

712
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,274
But fortunately,
the Crown Prince saved her.

713
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,063
-The Crown Prince?
-Yes.

714
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,856
She did a great job of humoring him.

715
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,519
She knows how to flatter too.

716
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,528
She drank every glass of alcohol
that he offered to her.

717
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,661
Where is she?

718
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,399
She is completely wasted.

719
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,573
Mu-deok, are you all right?

720
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,074
My pupil, you have come for me.

721
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,450
Yes, I am here for you, Master.

722
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,496
I have no control over my body.

723
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,173
I am also having trouble
keeping my head up.

724
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,840
This has never happened to me before,
no matter how much I drank.

725
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,508
You are no longer a skilled assassin.

726
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,795
You are just Mu-deok.

727
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,650
I cannot even hold my liquor in this body.

728
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,589
I want to give everything up
and live a quiet life.

729
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,013
But one thing keeps bothering me.

730
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,082
I thought I fell
from somewhere really high up.

731
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,668
But I guess it was not that high.

732
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,626
I think I broke my leg.

733
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,428
Help me.

734
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:50,019
I saw you using that
to summon your bird a few times.

735
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,725
I would also like to try.

736
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:56,231
Can I have that?

737
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,502
I came to give it back.

738
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,203
Mu-deok!

739
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,451
I saw Mu-deok.

740
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:55,246
She really is here.

741
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,172
Where is Uk?

742
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,419
I told you not to run.

743
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,760
What is going on?

744
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,049
Why are you here?

745
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,051
We could not find you at Sari Village,

746
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,643
so we came here
to look for you just in case.

747
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,310
Ju-wol was right. You really are here.

748
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,809
Mu-deok, have you been well?

749
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:15,937
Yes.

750
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:44,462
Look at you, Mu-deok.
You must be really happy to see him.

751
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,836
Oh, my gosh.

752
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:48,802
She is drunk.

753
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,547
Did she drink?

754
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,177
-Yes.
-Yes, she did.

755
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,104
Help her climb back up.

756
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:56,683
You can carry her.

757
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,905
Mu-deok used to come
to Danhyanggok to pick herbs.

758
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:12,198
A man named Master Lee lives here,
and he is letting us stay with him.

759
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,663
I cannot believe
Mu-deok got drunk all by herself.

760
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,084
She must be enjoying life.

761
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,826
I did not know there was
a place like this in Danhyanggok.

762
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,827
You knew about Danhyanggok?

763
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,087
He used to come here often in the past.

764
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,049
He got in trouble
for sneaking out all the time.

765
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,210
He did?

766
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,835
He was crazy about birds.

767
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,386
Why would you come here all by yourself?

768
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,970
You even broke your leg here.

769
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,229
Because I missed them.

770
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,859
The broken leg did not bother me.

771
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,740
And I was not scared to get scolded.

772
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,985
I liked them a lot.

773
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:10,632
He is way too fond of birds.

774
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,257
By the way, what kind of tea is this?

775
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,005
-It smells really nice.
-Did you drink that?

776
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,563
Yes. Why? Is it good for you?

777
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,441
Of course.

778
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,521
It was made with a medicinal herb

779
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,026
that can only be found in Danhyanggok.

780
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,189
Really?

781
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:31,356
-Yul, have some more.
-Do not drink…

782
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:32,912
Fine, go ahead.

783
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,239
-It really smells nice.
-Yes, I know.

784
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,292
That is chaste tea.

785
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,745
What? Chives tea?

786
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,421
You will all lose your…

787
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,047
-Is this made with chives?
-I am not sure if it was chives.

788
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:50,764
Well…

789
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,760
It was made
with a lot of ingredients. Drink up.

790
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,553
This is nice.

791
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,766
Enjoy.

792
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,175
A group of suspicious men
had my Spirit Plaque?

793
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,640
Yes.

794
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,639
Did you really lose your Spirit Plaque?

795
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,061
Did someone steal it from you,
or did you lend it?

796
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,350
No, I lost it.

797
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,984
Do you remember
when and where you lost it?

798
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:48,653
No.

799
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,231
We found it while investigating
the soul shifter's case.

800
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,147
This is very important and dangerous.

801
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,540
The marriage of Jin Cho-yeon and Jang Uk?

802
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,672
That is a magnificent idea.

803
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,960
But when two people get married,
they should love each other.

804
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:15,756
He cannot marry someone he does not love,
just to resolve an urgent matter.

805
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:19,721
Look at you babbling on about love.
That is why you two are still single.

806
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,306
Marriage is no fantasy.

807
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,930
I know what love is.

808
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,097
I even once

809
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:29,855
turned my back on my own master for love.

810
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,479
However, it was all for nothing.

811
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,686
Let us push forward

812
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,435
with the wedding.

813
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,616
An unknown man has
broken our barrier and entered.

814
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:50,791
Heo Yeom, come outside and greet me.

815
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:54,666
Who dares to call me by my name?

816
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,508
Yeom.

817
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,102
Have you been well?

818
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,060
Master.

819
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:06,931
Master.

820
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,693
Master!

821
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,229
Master.

822
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,273
Goodness, Master.

823
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,357
Oh, dear.

824
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,323
Put down your swords! Put them away!

825
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,221
Mu-deok.

826
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,812
I thought you were sleeping.
I looked for you everywhere.

827
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,730
Are you still drunk?

828
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,024
I thought I might be able to climb it
when I was drunk.

829
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:55,646
But it is too tall.
I am starting to sober up.

830
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,277
Is this the tree
with the bird's nest on top?

831
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,401
Yes.

832
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,914
I want to climb up that tree again.

833
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:08,704
Did you really climb
all the way to the top?

834
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,674
I was Naksu then.

835
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,252
The moon from up there looked beautiful.

836
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,804
But I can no longer see it with this body.

837
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,006
I ran into one of Danju's men today.

838
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:26,178
He seemed suspicious of me.

839
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:29,807
By any chance,
did you give him my Spirit Plaque?

840
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,102
I tried to use the Spirit Plaque
to go back.

841
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,555
But he killed the person
whom he thought was me.

842
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,607
If I ever happen to get caught by them,

843
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:42,858
do not try to save me.

844
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,987
Of course. I am too weak to help anyway.

845
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:52,078
There is nothing
your pupil can do for you.

846
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:56,996
I expected nothing from you.

847
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:01,804
Mu-deok.

848
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:05,386
I may not be able to do much,
but I think I can climb that tree.

849
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,062
There are no branches
for you to stand on at the top.

850
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,097
You must use your energy
to create a foothold.

851
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:15,186
You must master Chisu in order to do that.

852
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,523
You are nowhere near that level.

853
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,396
I wanted to do nothing,

854
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,032
but I feel motivated to climb this tree.

855
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,240
You said you want
to see the moon from there.

856
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,497
I am the only one
who can take you up there,

857
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,500
so I would like to try.

858
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,131
Do you wish to go up there?

859
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:42,171
You must master Chisu
in order to be able to climb up there.

860
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:45,432
Do you wish to go up there?

861
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,473
Then do me a favor, Uk.

862
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,226
Take me up there.

863
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:58,479
Fine.

864
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:01,824
I will take you to the top of that tree.

865
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,284
How is Uk doing?

866
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,034
Do you know who my real father is?

867
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:53,736
Nobody is expecting you
to come to that duel.

868
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:56,957
His next step could lead him to his death.

869
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,169
Is your young master aware of that?

870
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:02,339
You have met Naksu when you were young?

871
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:03,799
I do not know her name or age.

872
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,759
Other than the cliff
where we called out for birds,

873
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:07,379
I have never been to her abode.

874
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,636
Is this the Jin family's abode?

875
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,468
